172w9gt,I have changed my mind about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Have you?,"For the past decade or so I have typically supported Palestine fighting for it's right to having a homeland. However, I just watched about 30 videos of events that took place today. What I saw was not people fighting for their homeland but people murdering, desecrating corpses innocent people. This is terrorism, plain and simple. In a couple instances it was Israeli soldiers which is at least not innocent civilians but the way they treated their bodies and paraded them and stomped on them is disgusting. I can now see why Israel needs to defend itself and it's people. I don't think they should be bombing equally innocent people on the Palestine side but I can see why they should defend themselves because the things I saw today we're revolting and horrific. I still think both sides should still strive to find peace but I am not sure if this is even possible after today's acts. Hamas likely will need to be eradicated and eliminated, vile people.

Has anyone else changed their mind, either way?",08/10/23 10:51:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/172w9gt/i_have_changed_my_mind_about_the_israelpalestine/,4888,2810,175,Israel,top,all
1736ce5,I am done with the the deafening silence from the Muslim community.,"I think it's time to discuss what will happen to the people living in Gaza. They are under Hamas rule. Hamas is going use their deaths for further justification for a prolonged conflict in Israel. I don't see a resolution in sight but I do see the hard reality on the ground.

Now that this heinous act has occurred and the true face of militant Islam has been shown it is up to the nonviolent majority of muslims to speak out against these disgusting acts of violence.

nb3trt,Both sides are being mislead of the full truth,"So this is my compilation of how this whole thing started, after a lot of research from both sides, since each was holding back information and using it to instigate hate towards the opposite group

So first the prime minister was facing elections and most of the people who would vote for him are Jews, he wanted to get on their good side so he broke peace treaties that allowed housing of Palestinians in Jerusalem after the war took away their property and they had nowhere to live 

Extremist Jews jumped on the opportunity because they believe that Israel is theirs and needs to be populated by only Jews, and for years they have been settling places on the borders of the country to try and claim ""there are too many Jews here for it not to be considered our land and we outnumber Arabs so they should be kicked out"" 

It caused a court case that lasted a while, both sides providing proof that it is their property from many years ago, and it was supposed to continue and be held on Jerusalem day 

That same week happened to be also Ramadan which is a holy time for Muslims and they may or may not be agitated at this time of the year, also because Jews celebrate them being kicked out of their land years ago and they started a riot in the Al Aqsa mosque

At that time it was under renovations and there were rocks lying around, it is unknown where they got fireworks and liquid fuel, maybe to celebrate Ramadan? But people assumed they organized it all 

The crowd was riled up partially by the housing situation, because it meant something deeper about them not feeling safe to live anywhere and that their documents that show it's their housing is suddenly meaningless and is being taken away as if they don't matter at all, just because of some racist people

The crowd started throwing rocks as they got riled up, at the police and some over the wall, trying to target Jews on the other side too? 
The police tried calming everyone down, didn't allow access to the Jews into the wall area, while trying to disarm the situation multiple times before needing to resort to more extreme measures 

They used rubber bullets and tear grenades to subdue the people to keep everyone from attacking each other 
The crowd that was throwing stones and fireworks at the police scattered in fear and some ran into the Al Aqsa mosque

People were praying at the mosque at the time and didn't know what was going on, especially because it was a holy time for them

The ones throwing rocks kept throwing them at the police from inside the mosque, and as the police was trying to continue to calm down the situation, the people praying were told that the police was trying to take over the mosque and were hiding in fear in it, some retaliating, and as the police didn't know who was who they used means that won't permeantly damage to contain the situation, such as using tear grenades

The following morning was Jerusalem day and the parade that usually takes occur on this day to represent the victory of Jews winning the war over the Arabs wasn't cancelled, and instead was held with enthusiasm, which riled up the Arabs even more given the circumstances.

Chamas then started shooting rockets at Israel at random, most of them were disarms by the iron dome, but it didn't get them all, and there were a few casualties. 

Also the Arabs riled in the streets, throwing rocks at cars and trying to forcefully beat up people in their car and pull them out, the car driver panicked and accidentally ran into a person on the sidewalk, but he was ok as he stood up, the agression was extreme and luckily the police arrived shortly after to disarm the situation

By this point, the Israeli defense force was taking measures to destroy the locations in which the rocket were shot from which the terrorists decided should be public civilian places such as schools and mosqes and hospitals, there by in order to disarm them there were casualties in lives of citizens and children 22 adults, 9 of which were children

The chamas kept retaliating and shooting about 200 more missiles at Israel in random, some actually hit places like tel Aviv and caused major damages and and injuries and some deaths in total 

Because the defences of Israel against rockets are great, there were less casualties on the Israeli side of the conflict, as they tried disarming the Palestinian sources of the missiles, and because they chose places that are public, innocent civilian suffered the consequences. 

And that spread all over the news outside of Israel and people were mad because they thought we knew there were children in there and we killed them anyway, but from the information we had, some terrorist leaders were in there, and because it's so difficult to know where they are they chose to act fast, people believe that netanyahu is in support of this due to his bias against Palestinians

This is documented from observing both sides of the story as of 12:30 pm may 12 2021, both sides didn't give all the information that occured and after some research this made more sense. There may be new information after this documented time period which isn't included.

I would like people to know the truth, I hate that hate is being spread by people with motives towards the opposing groups and it's costing lives on both sides just because of a spread if misinformation.",13/05/21 00:27:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nb3trt/both_sides_are_being_mislead_of_the_full_truth/,1320,645,952,Israel,top,all
176ttyf,Lets set things straight,"Hey reddit , My name is Ofek.
I was an israeli soldier , armored corps, and few days ago..I just found out that a kibutz I was entrusted with protecting for 1.5 years ( kibutz is kind of a village) been slaughtered, you know the story .
I cant bring myself to sleep, to stop crying, I feel just...lost, they were not part of any war , they were just people living their life .

So I see people standing with Gaza , let me set things straight.
You don't stand with Gaza, you stand with Hammas , they dont just slaughter my people, they slaughter their own , they are playing with lives for the sake of publicity , forcing people to stay in their homes after we told them to evacuate , so they could show atrocities all over the news, they force families to stay and die brutally in their homes .

And then I see LGBTQ standing with them...and thats i gotta say, just crazy.
I mean , CRAZY, if those people were to visit Gaza they would be slaughtered and their bodies would hang over the city walls as a reminder of what happens to people who thinks to be openly gay .

We are facing evil , evil that isnt scared to die, isnt scared that his people will die, it only wants one thing..that we suffer, even if they have nothing at the end, and there is no one , they just want to kill.
Every money israel ever gave them to actually build their city and care for their people, they took to fund bombs and weapons , and I am not just standing against them as an Israeli, I stand against them as a human , because this thing right here is the kind of s**t that will annihilate human race .

They got in this country, and they took an israeli Muslim male nurse, they heard him praying for his life in arabic, and they shot him in his chest nonetheless, cuff him and started running with him , he survived , he told the news that he recalled them saying in arabic "" good , now we have israeli hostage, they wont attack us from the air now"".

We fight them as humans , no muslim, no jew, no christian, left , right , straight , gay .

Only Humans .
Please , stop feeding into Hammas fake news, thats whats making them stronger, and stay united so those people crying for their lives while dying, while there is no one...no one to save them , will be the last.",13/10/23 08:19:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/176ttyf/lets_set_things_straight/,1063,1916,441,Israel,top,all
nem47n,You can be anti-Hamas but pro-Palestine,"I believe that Hamas is a very dangerous terrorist organization and we have to acknowledge all the violence they’ve done, but I also believe that a lot of the violence caused by Israel is unnecessary and inhumane.

172pypc,Pay attention to Pro Palestinian supporters,"Today was the worst massacre of Jews since WW2.

&#x200B;

Today we saw what ""Free Palestine"" and ""From the River to the Sea"" really means.

&#x200B;

* Palestinians murdered, kidnapped, and raped innocent Jews on a holiday, 50 years to the date of the Yom Kippur War.
* Palestinians murdered 400 Jews and counting.
* Palestinians  raped, mutilated and paraded with the naked body of a Jewish woman that they murdered as if she was a trophy.
* Palestinians anally raped a teenage Jewish girl and kidnapped her to Gaza.
* Palestinians murdered seniors who were merely sitting at a bus stop.
* Palestinians kidnapped children who they will likely torture and murder.
* Palestinians are beheaded Jewish soldiers in the streets.
* Palestinians are stopped vehicles and slit the throats of the people in them.
* Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are celebrating the massacre of Jews today.
* Palestinians around the world, such as in New York, London and Berlin, are celebrating the massacre of Jews today.
* Some of the images and videos we are seeing of Palestinians are similar to the works of other jihadis such as IS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

&#x200B;

If your takeaway from the massacre of 300 Jews is that the world has ignored the issue of a Palestinian state or some whataboutism, you are NOT a human rights advocate - YOU ARE AN ANTISEMITIC BIGOT. There is no justification for murder of innocent Jewish civilians. Land is not an excuse to pillage, rape, kidnap and murder,  especially when it wasn't their land to claim.

&#x200B;

The Palestinian cause has remained unevolved for 100 years and is an Antisemitic death cult, calling for the genocide of Jews. The irony is that Palestinian supporters scream cease-fire when Israel has to address the terrorism in Gaza but they will never condemn the rape, kidnapping and murder of innocent Jews which led to it.

&#x200B;

The 2 state solution is dead. The 1 state solution is dead.  You can thank Hamas, who was willfully elected by an overwhelming majority of Palestinians. Palestinians and their supporters have proved that they are not legitimate peace partners and at any opportunity, if they are not excusing the murder of innocent Jews, they are celebrating and/or partaking in it.

172eldi,To Palestinian Sympathizers:,"We Jews are the people who survived the Shoah. 6,000,000 were murdered.  

At Babi Yar, in Ukraine, 33,711 Jews were massacred on September 29-30, 1941.

A month before, August 28-30, 1941, 23,600 Jews were murdered at Kamenets-Podolsk.

November 3-4, 1943, 42,000 Jews were murdered in Operation Harvest Festival.

If you think murdering 200 Jews on October 7, 2023 is going to change the course of our history, you are sorely mistaken.  You have shattered 200+ families and have achieved nothing but the death warrant of Hamas. 

If you think you can support Palestine but not Hamas, remember that Hamas was elected to rule the Gaza Strip.  Abbas and the PLO are in the 18th year of their 4 year term and won’t hold new elections in the W Bank because Hamas will win and they want to cling to power without the support of the people.  

This is the crux of the entire conflict:  there is no partner for peace for Israel; the Palestinian street wants Hamas and war and destruction.

I am genuinely horrified by this. That almost ALL of the voices I used to agree with have all come to agree that any news that describes Hamas in a negative light, or depicts Israel as anything less than the third reich, is only further evidence of how evil Israel is with it shameless propaganda.

17xnsjh,"As a Jew, I am sick of people telling me what Zionism means.","Just to be clear, Zionism is generally agreed to be the belief that the State of Israel should exist as a Jewish country. Nothing more, nothing less.

I have heard too many people at this point saying that “the problem isn’t Jews, it’s Zionists.” 

First of all, 6 out of the ~15 million Jews (one of them being my father) are Israeli, and would very much like it for their country to exist. Outside of that, most diaspora Jews care about Israel existing because we know the history of persecution against our people and want Israel to exist not only for religious reasons, but also as a sanctuary for all Jews. Half of the Israeli population are descendants of Jewish refugees from all Arab countries, and just in the ’90s Israel had to and was able to let in 1 million former-Soviet Jewish refugees.

OF COURSE there are non-jews who are antisemitic and use Zionism as a cover for Islamophobia.

OF COURSE there are a few crazy Jewish settlers that continue to steak Palestinians homes deep in the West Bank

OF COURSE the Neturei Karta exist, but they are the minority and the vast majority of Jews are still Zionists.

My point is that just because there are Zionist extremists doesn’t mean that most Zionists are extremists, and that just because there are non-Zionist Jews doesn’t mean that Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism.

I am Jewish and Zionist. I don’t support Bibi’s government or his policies. I don’t hate Palestinians for existing or for wanting a state.

Do the people who post this phrase everywhere realize they’re indirectly blaming Israel for this entire conflict? Did they forget the war started because Hamas murdered 1200 civilians? 

The mostly liberal view that if we all just loved each other more everything would be fine is so naive. They do not understand that Hamas does not exist because people in Gaza are oppressed, it exists because since it’s inception almost every country in the region has tried to destroy Israel. Terrorism has nothing to do with poverty or oppression. Osama bin laden was very wealthy. Most of the leaders of Hamas are also very wealthy. 

The majority of people who post that stupid slogan are virtue signalling fools with no understanding of the conflict. If you do not defeat Hamas more Jews will die. They will exert revenge on Israel for this attack. You cannot simply show the people in Gaza more compassion and expect Hamas to give up. It’s such a bad argument. 

Israel should respect the human rights of people in Gaza but they need to defeat Hamas if they want to survive as a nation. As far as I can tell the only way to do this is by invading the territory.

18t3q2y,"NY Times investigation of rapes on 10/7 verifies reports, concludes rapes were not isolated events.","I can't begin to count the number of people I have interacted with that have dismissed or questioned the Hamas rapes on 10/7. Some people said out loud that they don't believe a word coming from Israel or Jewish eye witnesses, while other hide behind ""a lack of forensic evidence and rape kits"".

Notwithstanding the suggestive public footage, reports from the first responders, morgue attendants, pathologists and police investigations that confirmed these reports, hopefully the findings of this 3rd-party investigation will serve as a wake-up call to the more moderate of the people that still deny these rapes.

Excerpts from [the NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/28/world/middleeast/oct-7-attacks-hamas-israel-sexual-violence.html) from 12/28/2023, lightly edited for continuity. \[[Archive link](https://archive.is/aFPBa)\]

**Warning - VERY GRAPHIC descriptions:**

* A two-month investigation by The Times uncovered painful new details, establishing that the attacks against women **were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence on Oct. 7.**
* In a grainy video, you can see her, lying on her back, dress torn, legs spread, vagina exposed. Her face is burned beyond recognition and her right hand covers her eyes....Based largely on the video evidence — which was verified by The New York Times — Israeli police officials said they believed that Ms. \[Gal\] Abdush was raped, and she has become a symbol of the horrors visited upon Israeli women and girls during the Oct. 7 attacks. EDIT - [this is the video](https://www.hamas-massacre.net/content/woman-who-was-raped-and-burned-to-death) they mention - NSFW.
* The Times viewed photographs of one woman’s corpse that emergency responders discovered in the rubble of a besieged kibbutz with dozens of nails driven into her thighs and groin.
* Sapir, a 24-year-old accountant, has become one of the Israeli police’s key witnesses. In a two-hour interview outside a cafe in southern Israel, she recounted seeing groups of heavily armed gunmen rape and kill at least five women...at 8 a.m. on Oct. 7, she was hiding under the low branches of a bushy tamarisk tree, just off Route 232, about four miles southwest of the party. She had been shot in the back...felt faint...covered herself in dry grass and lay as still as she could. About 15 meters from her hiding place she saw motorcycles, cars and trucks pulling up. She saw about 100 men, most of them dressed in military fatigues and combat boots, a few in dark sweatsuits, getting in and out of the vehicles. The men congregated along the road and passed between them assault rifles, grenades, small missiles — and badly wounded women. “It was like an assembly point.” **The first victim she saw** was a young woman with copper-color hair, blood running down her back, pants pushed down to her knees. One man pulled her by the hair and made her bend over. Another penetrated her, Sapir said, and every time she flinched, he plunged a knife into her back....While one terrorist raped her, another pulled out a box cutter and sliced off her breast.....“One continues to rape her, and the other throws her breast to someone else, and they play with it, throw it, and it falls on the road,”....the men sliced her face and then the woman fell out of view. Around the same time, she saw three other women raped and terrorists carrying the severed heads of three more women....Yura Karol, a 22-year-old security consultant, said he was hiding in the same spot, and he can be seen in one of Sapir’s photos.... In an interview, Mr. Karol said he barely lifted his head to look at the road but he also described seeing a woman raped and killed.
* Raz Cohen....saw five men, wearing civilian clothes, all carrying knives and one carrying a hammer, dragging a woman across the ground. She was young, naked and screaming. “They all gather around her,” Mr. Cohen said. “She’s standing up. They start raping her. I saw the men standing in a half circle around her. One penetrates her. She screams. I still remember her voice, screams without words.” “Then one of them raises a knife,” he said, “and they just slaughtered her.” Shoam Gueta, one of Mr. Cohen’s friends and a fashion designer, said the two were hiding together in the streambed. He said he saw at least four men step out of the van and attack the woman, who ended up “between their legs.” He said that they were “talking, giggling and shouting,” and that one of them stabbed her with a knife repeatedly, “literally butchering her.”
* Yinon Rivlin, a member of the rave’s production team who lost two brothers in the attacks, said that after hiding from the killers, he emerged from a ditch and made his way to the parking area, east of the party, along Route 232, looking for survivors. Near the highway, he said, he found the body of a young woman, on her stomach, no pants or underwear, legs spread apart. He said her vagina area appeared to have been sliced open, “as if someone tore her apart.”
* Captain Maayan asked to be identified only by her rank and surname because of the sensitivity of the subject. She said she had seen several bodies with cuts in their vaginas and underwear soaked in blood and one whose fingernails had been pulled out.
* **There are at least three women and one man who were sexually assaulted and survived**, according to Gil Horev, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. “None of them has been willing to come physically for treatment,” he said. Two therapists said they were working with a woman who was gang raped at the rave and was in no condition to talk to investigators or reporters.",28/12/23 20:31:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18t3q2y/ny_times_investigation_of_rapes_on_107_verifies/,495,1178,946,Israel,top,all

177n2aj,I am from Israel. Please HEAR OUR VOICE,"Imagine you wake up in your bed for the sound of alarms and explosions.

Imagine seeing your family murdered before your eyes.

Imagine you are taken to Gaza, bodies all around you, all family and dear friends. People you have known all your life.

Imagine having to run on foot with a baby on your arms, dodging bullets, crying and begging for your life and praying to god.

Can't?

Thats ok. It a hard thing to imagine.

But that was our reality that black Saturday, the October 7th.

They took our kids. They took our infant babies. They took our moms, fathers, and grandparents. They took them to Gaza, and the rest, they killed and raped, not necessarily in that order. They burned homes, killed babies in their cribs, shot families in their living rooms one by one, so the others could see. They erased WHOLE FAMILIES, and then they burned their bodies. That made the identification process much harder so some of the family members who did manage to survive, still waiting to know TO THIS DAY, the 8th day of the war, if their family or friends are somehow alive in Gaza or found dead in their home garden.

They don't know what to hope for.

They massacred a music fest party of our young, and they raped and burned whoever they could. Killed hundreds of young folks who only wished to dance and spread love. The party was protected by some officers, but Hamas was so many, not even one officer was left alive.

Some people hid in the bushes for the whole day, without food and water, scared to their teeth.

Some of these people hid in bonkers for the whole day, terrified. Some were discovered hiding in clothes closets, taken and shot, or worse. the others tried to keep their kids and babies quiet while they hear how all the people they ever knew are massacred outside their safe-room window. You feel hopeless. You say your goodbyes. you prepare for the worst.

THOSE ACT ARE NOT HUMAN.All they want is to kill and destroy, and they use whatever means they have, even on the account of their **own families and children**, who they teach to hate from a very young age.

At least 1,400 dead to this day and we haven't collected/counted al the bodies yet.

&#x200B;

When they captured Rachel (Who managed to escape), They told her they are glad to be Shahid, and that their kids are proud and want to follow them.

THATS WHAT THEY TEACH THEIR KIDS. To hate, and to die for that hate.

THEY ARE THE ENEMY, not only for us, but for Palestinians civilians from Gaza and from everywhere as well.

175eput,Young American Jew Feeling Alienated,"Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this but I just want to share my thoughts the past few days in an honest way and start conversation among young Jews. I do not feel comfortable sharing my thoughts with any of my Jewish friends and family. I wanted to post this in the r/Judaism thread but they prohibit Israel/Palestine content so this seems like the next best place. 

I’ll try to be as brief as possible, so some nuance may be lost for the sake of brevity. I feel alienated by the American Jewish community for my thoughts on the recent violence in Israel/Palestine. These are my thoughts: 1) I condemn Hamas’ war crimes against Israelis. 2) I condemn the Israeli government’s war crimes against Palestinians. 3) I mourn for the innocent lives lost of all nationalities in the past days. I am absolutely flabbergasted that saying these 3 things simultaneously is considered controversial— to me all of these things should be patently obvious and non-controversial. Yet if I shared these views on social media, my Jewish friends and family would be furious at me for mentioning Israeli and Hamas war crimes in the same breath and call me a self-hating Jew who believes Israelis deserved to die. They would attack me for mentioning both Israeli and Palestinian victims, because it implies that Israel is equally as bad as Hamas. 

Acknowledging the historical impacts of the West Bank occupation and Gaza siege is not equivalent to saying that “Israeli victims deserved to die”. Multiple things can be true at once: Hamas is directly responsible for its war crimes AND anti-Palestinian Israeli policies over the past decades created a powder keg ready to erupt in Gaza. I believe it’s important to recognize the full context of the violence, especially when thinking about how further violence can be prevented in the future. I’ve seen several Israeli commentators state this same sentiment in recent articles.

Basically I feel like a crazy person for simply mourning for both Israelis and Palestinians and acknowledging basic historical realities. I know I’ll probably get hate comments here as well because that’s how it goes. But please just know that I come from a place of good faith— I am genuinely devastated by the recent deaths of civilians and only wish that I could honestly discuss where to go from here with fellow Jews without being verbally attacked. I wonder if any other Jews feel the same way.",11/10/23 14:01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/175eput/young_american_jew_feeling_alienated/,443,742,412,Israel,top,all
17aj4u8,IDF issues conclusive proof that the hospital explosion was not caused by an air strike.,"The IDF has just released [HD footage of the aftermath](https://x.com/manniefabian/status/1714505284410921118?s=20) from the hospital explosion. It shows burnt out shells of cars but no crater that would be indicative of a JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition). In addition, the structural damage in the surrounding area appears to be quite low. As such it is likely that a misfired rocket hit the parking lot where numerous Palestinians were gathered and the high death toll was caused by shrapnel (likely ball bearings) added to rockets in order to increase their killing range.

nxn8du,"Yes, the nakba actually happened","A lot pro-Israel folk seem to think 800,000 Palestinians happily and voluntarily abandoned their lives to become refugees in 1948. This could not be further from the truth.

A report from the military intelligence SHAI of the Haganah titled ""The emigration of Palestinian Arabs in the period 1/12/1947-1/6/1948"", dated 30 June 1948, affirms that: At least 55% of the total of the exodus was caused by our (Haganah/IDF) operations. To this figure, the report's compilers add the operations of the Irgun and Lehi, which ""directly (caused) some 15%... of the emigration"". A further 2% was attributed to explicit expulsion orders issued by Israeli troops, and 1% to their psychological warfare. This leads to a figure of 73% for departures caused directly by the Israelis. In addition, the report attributes 22% of the departures to ""fears"" and ""a crisis of confidence"" affecting the Palestinian population. **As for Arab calls for flight, these were reckoned to be significant in only 5% of cases...**""

Check this out: [Burying the Nakba: How Israel Systematically Hides Evidence of 1948 Expulsion of Arabs - Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-how-israel-systematically-hides-evidence-of-1948-expulsion-of-arabs-1.7435103)

""A censorship board composed of five Cabinet members prohibited former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin from including in his memoirs a first‐person account of the expulsion of 50,000 Palestinian civilians from their homes near Tel Aviv during the 1948 Arab‐Israeli war.""

https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/23/archives/israel-bars-rabin-from-relating-48-eviction-of-arabs-sympathy-for.html

“Psychologically, this was one of the most difficult actions we undertook. The population of Lod did not leave willingly. There was no way of avoiding the use of force and warning shots in order to make the inhabitants march the 10 to 15 miles to the point where they met up with the legion."" - Yitzhak Rabin

In “0 Jerusalem,” Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre described “a calculated Israeli policy” to drive Arab residents from their homes, and they confirmed reports by some survivors that many elderly people and small children died in the overpowering heat during the forced march.

""Contingents of the extremist Stern gang and Irgun attacked the village and lined men, women and children up against walls and shot them, according to Red Cross and British documentation.""

""A major expulsion took place at Qisarya, south of Haifa, where Palestinian Arabs were evicted and their houses destroyed on 19–20 February 1948. In attacks that were not authorised in advance, several communities were expelled by the Haganah and several others were chased away by the Irgun."""" - Benny Morris

""During the ""long seminar"", a meeting of Ben-Gurion with his chief advisors in January 1948, the main point was that it was desirable to ""transfer"" as many Arabs as possible out of Jewish territory, and the discussion focussed mainly on the implementation...Plan Dalet was the master plan for the expulsion of the Palestinians."" - Ilan Pappe

According to Morris, ""The Haganah mortar attacks of 21–22 April [on Haifa] were primarily designed to break Arab morale in order to bring about a swift collapse of resistance and speedy surrender. [...] But clearly the offensive, and especially the mortaring, precipitated the exodus. The three-inch mortars ""opened up on the market square [where there was] a great crowd [...] a great panic took hold. The multitude burst into the port, pushed aside the policemen, charged the boats and began to flee the town"", as the official Haganah history later put it"". According to Pappé, this mortar barrage was deliberately aimed at civilians to precipitate their flight from Haifa.

""The orders of Carmeli's 22nd Battalion were ""to kill every Arab encountered"" and to set alight with fire-bombs ""all objectives that can be set alight.""

Israeli vans with loudspeakers drove through the streets ordering all the inhabitants to evacuate immediately, and such as were reluctant to leave were forcibly ejected from their homes by the triumphant Israelis whose policy was now openly one of clearing out all the Arab civil population before them... From the surrounding villages and hamlets, during the next two or three days, all the inhabitants were uprooted and set off on the road to Ramallah... No longer was there any ""reasonable persuasion"". Bluntly, the Arab inhabitants were ejected and forced to flee into Arab territory... Wherever the Israeli troops advanced into Arab country the Arab population was bulldozed out in front of them.",11/06/21 18:47:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nxn8du/yes_the_nakba_actually_happened/,436,797,702,Israel,top,all

nfdqbm,"That how Hamas says ""Thank you""","Israel had reopened the passages into the Strip earlier in the day to let in badly needed fuel, medical equipment.

The move was hailed by the United Nations in light of the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, whose sole power plant has been rationing fuel and cutting electricity service to the beleaguered enclave.

While the crossings were opened, terrorists in the Strip launched a large mortar barrage across the border, reportedly firing dozens of shells throughout the area, including at Kerem Shalom and Erez.

As a result, a 19-year-old soldier was hurt by mortar fire while assisting in transfer of aid at Gaza crossing. Israel has closed the reopened passages again following the attack.

18hgedt,This is why no Arab voices speak against Hamas..,"Dalia Ziada. A muslim (+ hijabi!) writer, and liberal/peace activist from Egypt. She dared to speak on what she saw on October 7th. She called it what it is; a horrific terrorist attack. She said Israel had the right to defend itself and understandably cannot stop until Hamas is no longer a threat. 

She was called a Zionist, a Traitor, and everyone in Egypt wanted her persecuted for high treason, the punishment of which is life in prison. All this, for a mere statement. For putting what she saw into words without eliminating or editing anything. This is largely why there is no opposition in the Arab world, you either believe and parrot the common narrative, or you’re an enemy of the state. Imprisoned or killed.

I myself have experienced similar situations, even on this sub where people question my origins and call me a liar for saying I am of Palestinian descent. They have no idea that people like me exist, because we are consistently silenced and shunned. It is an unforgivable sin to speak against “your people” . And while “the other side” clearly has living, breathing opposition that doesn’t shy away from criticizing every aspect of their government and their policies, which only adds to the depth and richness of this side’s experience, there’s a clear lack of such richness of opinion on our side. Not only that, but “my side” uses the “other side’s” opposition against them! While they shut down anyone who dares to speak against their policies 🤦🏻‍♀️

nc0y47,My feelings as a Palestinian living in Israel,"About me: I am a 23 year old Computer Engineering Student at the Technion(Israel's MIT equivalent). I speak fluently, read and write Hebrew, Arabic and English.  I am part of a peace seeking organization that has Israeli Jews, Palestinians from the West bank and inside the Israeli borders. I had countless exposure to all the people here except Gaza. I was born in Jaffa, a mixed city right next to Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv and Jaffa have one municipality -- the Tel Aviv Jaffa municipality. I am a liberal, secular, progressive person in my values. I spend all my time thinking about this conflict pretty much. I have been to the West Bank and to the Negev deserts in the south.

I feel completely hopeless and unsafe.
There is a Jewish mob in my birth city that is looking for Arabs in the streets to kill sometimes even forcing their way into homes and they're destroying Arab businesses and just like in the Kristelnacht the state is not stopping the violent mob. I have seen with my own eyes and I have video evidence of the Cops walking right alongside an angry Jewish mob that is yelling ""Death to Arabs"". I also have a video of me and some of my neighbours getting violently dispersed by a bunch of Armed cops for sitting in the public garden just because we are Arabs. We weren't even protesting and I wish I was kidding.
The only people who are providing me with any sense of safety are armed toxic macho and crime culture Arab families that fight back when the Jewish mob enters our neighborhoods to hunt us down. Even then the fight is hopeless. Racist radical right Jewish supremacists are coming from settlements in buses armed with Automatic weapons(I have video proof) and the cops just do nothing. They are the majority and they are backed by a very militaristically powerful state.

My main conclusion is that Israel is a racist state and that Zionism is a toxic ideology that the Jewish majority must move on from completely. Zionism in the future is gonna be one of the ideologies that the educated moral liberals are not gonna look kindly upon. Just like fascism and other apartheid racist regimes. The Jewish public has much higher quality of life and access to education and the Palestinians have nothing left to compromise. If you have a majority public that is educated in higher institutions with higher quality of life and they're still as bloodthirsty and extreme as this in Israel. Then don't expect anything less than insanely insane radicalism from the Gazans in all its forms.

18uy4di,As a Muslim woman I support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish State.,"Here are the reasons why. 

1.) Israel is the indigenous homeland of the Jewish People. The Jewish people have existed in that land for 3000 years. You will find Jewish graves from that time period, Jewish artifacts in the ground. The cities that exist are all Jewish names. Israel lives  and breathes Jewish History. 

2.) Judaism was the first Abrahamic religion they just want to mind their own business in their little land, they don’t proselytize and are not interested and were never interested in conquering or converting anyone. They just want to live in peace. 

3.) Jewish people have always wanted to go back to their homeland. They have been expelled from it by many empires, had their temples destroyed. Yet they kept up this hope for 2000 years. Every Passover they would say “ Next Year In Jerusalem” 

4.) Jewish people have been massacred and prosecuted in every single diaspora community they have lived in for simply being Jewish. There is no other community in the history of humanity that has been prosecuted for their religion like the Jews have. 

5.) Jewish people are resilient they went through so much trauma and have found ways to survive. I admire them as a Muslim woman because I can understand being confronted with so much bigotry and barriers against you. 

6.) Jewish people are progressive and they support many progressive movements such as the civil rights movement, women’s rights movement, they also stand up for other minorities who are being prosecuted for their religion and their ethnicity. 

7.) Jewish people have helped me. When I emigrated to the US as a refugee. Jewish American organizations helped me with clothes, resources. I also have a lot of Jewish friends and co-workers who are the one of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever met. 

8.) Israel is a country and just like every other country they make mistakes. We can criticize the policies of Israel and not wish for Israel’s destruction. Muslims and Arabs have killed way more Muslims/ Arabs than Israel ever has. No one has ever wanted to wipe Syria or Iraq off the map for the actions of those governments but everyone wants to wipe Israel off the map. 

9.) if Israel ceases to exist this will put Jews worldwide in danger. Everyone dislikes Jews and wants to murder them. Israel is essential for Jewish safety. 

10.) Israel tries to make peace with its neighbors. Since the inception of Israel they have tried to have a seat at the table with its neighbors but they have all tried destroying Israel. 

To conclude this post, Israel and the Jewish people are not the monsters they are made out to be. They are humans just like us and they make mistakes but denying their right to exist in their homeland is cruel knowing their history.",31/12/23 03:26:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18uy4di/as_a_muslim_woman_i_support_israels_right_to/,408,196,476,Israel,top,all

Let me be clear I am absolutely SICK to my stomach about what Hamas have done to the Israelis. But that aside I wanna once again talk about Hamas’s impact on the Palestinians. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: we don’t know how many people in Gaza ACTUALLY support Hamas because they’re documented to execute critics and political rivals. I wish video posts were allowed here because I saw a video of a mother in Gaza who lost her children calling Hamas dogs and three men were holding her that appeared to be her family members. They quickly put their hands on her mouth and told her to be quiet and BBC had to blur her face. They didn’t blur anyone else’s faces. You wanna know why? Because if Hamas were to find out who she was they’d BRUTALLY torture and execute her. And that’s what’s so frustrating about the worldwide Hamas support. Even if you support Palestinians, let me be ABSOLUTELY AND ABUNDANTLY CLEAR: HAMAS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR OWN CIVILIANS. Hamas officials have just admitted they don’t believe Gazan civilians are their responsibility and so they built shelters for their COWARDLY selves but not their people AND they added fuel to the fire in the midsts of THEIR PEOPLE BEING KILLED by stating that they’ll keep repeating October 7th until “israel is destroyed” and that everything they do is “justified”. I speak Arabic so I can confirm the translations were accurate. Hamas have a selfish goal of Islamic world domination in which they will be the leaders. Destruction of Israel is only step one for them. Tone deaf and brainwashed Palestinians and their supporters outside Gaza champion and make excuses for Hamas from their places of privilege without having any regard for how AWFUL Hamas have been for their own people.Especially when non Palestinians try to defend Hamas. As a Palestinian this all makes me ANGRY! Hamas did these attacks knowing Israel would strike back with great force and they prepared themselves for it but not the “people they’re fighting for”. I understand why Israel want to eradicate Hamas although I wish they were more calculated because it’s simply wrong to kill 400 Palestinian civilians just to target one Hamas member (the refugee camp). I feel like we should all agree on that. I want Hamas gone and I know they use their people as human shields but Israel could do more to minimize civilian casualties. In any case Hamas need to be eradicated for the sake of ALL of humanity, Israelis, Jews, Palestinians, and the world.

1bjj1z3,No country would have responded differently than Israel has to what happened on October 7th ,"If October 7th happened in the United States the equivalent would be 56,520 American civilians would have been killed on that day in the most brutal way possible, and 9,936 would have been taken hostage.

I urge people to see what precisely happened in Israel by going to Hamas-massacre.net, and also view the way Hamas portrays what occurred by going to Hamas.com and see for themselves. Ask yourself how your country would have responded to such a savage and deplorable attack on civilians. 

It is absurd to suggest that any Western country would have responded differently than Israel since that day. Unless any other country or coalition of countries would like to put boots on the ground to guarantee security to Israel, then any criticism of Israel’s response is just words with no meaning. Of course Israel will take the opinions of its allies into consideration, but at the end of the day Israel is going to do what it needs to do to protect its civilians. 

The war is against Hamas not against Palestinians, and the numbers support it. Israel has dropped over 29,000 bombs on Gaza, and around 30,000 Palestinians have been killed. Anyone who knows how easy it is to kill people with bombs would realize that an almost 1:1 ratio of bombs to death is extremely targeted ammunitions regardless of the fact that Hamas has deeply embedded itself within civilian populations. 

Any assertion that Israel is targeting civilians is a gross misrepresentation of what is going on in the war. Rather than pressuring Israel to come to a ceasefire, countries should pressure Hamas to release all the hostages and lay down its arms.",20/03/24 17:26:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bjj1z3/no_country_would_have_responded_differently_than/,393,1264,277,Israel,top,all

Israel has mosques, Arab quarters, Arab neighbourhoods, and visibly a lot of Muslims considering how tiny the country is. Israel is about the same size as New Jersey. 

I'm sorry if these things don't go hand in hand. I'm not super educated nor am I a wordsmith, so my post may sound stupid. 

When I went to Israel, I was not expecting to see as many Muslims as I did, especially being told that Israel is full of white Jews and not much else. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. It's a very diverse bunch of people, many black people including Arabs that all seemingly get along. I know that's just my perspective as a month long tourist, but I think it's important. 

When I went to visit Cesarea, a big Muslim wedding was held with 200 or so guests that were nearly all Muslims. Then there was another smaller Muslim wedding held near the beach that same day. Both beautiful weddings, with happy, beautiful brides. I also witnessed the Islamic prayer call in Jaffa/Tel Aviv. 

So, if Israel wanted to erase every aspect of these people, would such incidents take place?  Would such monuments be preserved and protected? I'm honestly asking.

179bvvf,What is it with the American left and downplaying Hamas?,"I am a full Leftist on pretty much everything, but this is one thing that confuses me a lot. Let me also clarify, that I don’t agree with the right wing position on this subject either (basically just the opposite of this, supporting Israel and downplaying their government’s atrocities). But, as a member of multiple leftist communities on this site, I am constantly seeing people fully supporting Palestine with the justification that what Hamas does isn’t as bad as what Israel does. I can agree with the justification to an extent, since Israel is just as guilty as Hamas when it comes to oppression and violence, but what I don’t understand is everyone chanting “Free Palestine” and showing no remorse for the Israeli people that were harmed. About the phrase “Free Palestine”: on a surface level, this phrase is perfectly fine. However, I like to compare this phrase to the phrase “All Lives Matter”. On a surface level, there’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s the stigma and history behind it that makes it offensive to say. With all lives matter, it’s due to it being against the blm movement, and with free Palestine, especially since these horrific events occurred, it’s due to the phrase subtly implying that the actions of Hamas are justifiable, and even more so, completely disregarding the suffering of those in Israel. Now, I really want to give the left the benefit of the doubt that they don’t support Hamas, but it’s starting to get really difficult, with people implying that their actions are for a greater cause. I’m not necessarily saying that they support Hamas, but I really am starting to see a pattern of them never bringing up the horrible things Hamas has done and only hating on Israel; same with the right, they only talk about how horrible Hamas is with no regards to the atrocities of the Israeli government. I’m not saying that it’s a 50/50 necessarily, but neither side is justified in the slightest, and all our support should be aimed towards the innocent people of both sides rather than the oppressors of either side. I really want to understand the left on this, because it feels so bizarre that I’d disagree with them so hard on this, but I just can’t.",16/10/23 17:43:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/179bvvf/what_is_it_with_the_american_left_and_downplaying/,383,1125,381,Israel,top,all

1ak1bdd,Palestine is Ruining the Left,"I'm an Israeli-American leftist who has been active in American and Israeli politics for a number of years now. I have always advocated for human rights, equity, and self-determination for Palestinians who are oppressed(to different extents) under Israel, a nation that commits itself to Jewish domination of institutions. I always voted and campaigned for progressive Democrats and I assisted with the Israeli Meretz party from abroad. This is why I think the current Palestinian-sympathetic movement is ruining the left:

1. **Abandonment of Pragmatism** \- Just like the 2020 George Floyd protests(""Defund the Police""), the Western left has completely embraced a suicidal strategy of idealistic radicalism. Many of those on the left insist the solution to the conflict is a one-state solution consisting of Palestine ""from the River to the Sea"". Unfortunately, they've appropriated the Palestinian mythology in their ambitions to magically destroy Israel and the ideology of Zionism by BDS somehow or supporting Palestinian ""armed struggle"". It doesn't take a lot of thought to see how both of those methods are incredibly ineffective and immoral to advocate for and implement. So, instead of a pragmatic approach, like empowering the Israeli left through donations and advocacy, supporting a reasonable solution(two-state or one-state under Israel), or calling for the ultimate humanitarian end to the war of a unilateral Hamas surrender, the Western left insists on a dream scenario that will never happen. This is the most egregious behavior of the left and it's their most common mistake(i.e. Vietnam). This is due to the fact that Palestinians, especially in Gaza, are suffering under disproportionate Israeli force with no Western movement to realistically end it. In fact, these Western leftists, due to these tactics, are assisting in empowering and legitimizing the far-right of Israel. They are the perfect strawman to turn people off to the left in Israel, which, in turn, results in a lengthened Palestinian suffering.
2. **Maximalism** \- There's a tendency on the left to outcompete each other in radicalism. It's not catchy or sexy to say ""The war tactics that Israel uses are disproportionate and don't consider enough of the humanitarian cost"", it has to be ""genocide"" or ""ethnic cleansing"" in order to provoke an emotional reaction from uneducated Westerners. It's not ""the security policy of Hafradah has resulted in reduced human rights of Palestinians compared to Israelis"", it has to be ""Apartheid""(with the only legal precedent being South Africa). These maximalist statements immeasurably hurt the movement for true progress on Palestinian human rights. It results in a boy-who-cried-wolf situation: If Israel decides to transfer the entire Gazan population to the Sinai, what is that called? A ""genocide""? Due to the present labeling of the war, nobody will believe it. What if Israel permanently transfers or kills 100,000 Palestinian civilians? 200,000? 1 million? What will that be called? How can it get worse than ""genocide""? This Maximalist rhetoric is not only inaccurate, but it's incredibly damaging to describe the proportionate extent of Palestinian suffering, which is vital to any movement that faithfully advocates for an upliftment of Palestinian life and identity.
3. **Normalization of Bigotry** \- Explicit or latent Jew-Hatred is being increasingly embraced by radical sections of the Western left. Tropes such as ""Zionist""(a euphemism for ""Jew"" for many) control of governments or blood libel. Wishing ""Death to Zionists"" or equating them with Nazis is, in most cases, latent Jew-Hatred. Regardless of your thoughts on the definition of Zionism(there is no definition, it is a meaningless term), it's clear that many believe that ""Zionists"" are just uppity Jews. Of course, this is genuinely believed by a small portion of the left. However, a substantial part of Western leftists has repeatedly failed to condemn this Jew-Hatred and to stop mirroring the language of these latent or explicit Jew-Haters. This is 1000x worse in the case of Israelis. For Western leftists, it's normal to call Israelis ""colonizers"", ""demons"", ""rapists"", and ""child-murderers"" on their social media without repercussion or introspective irony. As somebody belonging to the Israeli nationality, I have been desensitized to the insane amount of bigotry from those that I formerly respected. However, many Israelis or Jews aren't as depersonalized as I am, and they definitely take the bigotry to heart. What do you think results from that? Usually, a vote for Likud(Netanyahu's Party) or a donation to AIPAC. Thus, propagating a cycle of bigotry and continuing the suffering of Palestinians.
4. **Propaganda** \- This war has sparked the largest disinformation campaigns in human history. Multiple state entities (Israel, U.S., Russia, Iran, Qatar) and numerous private entities are pumping out loads of propaganda in order to manipulate uneducated Westerners into supporting their interests. Since October 7th, known Russian disinformation propagator, Jackson Hinkle, has skyrocketed in followers due to his ability to mislead Western leftists on the war. I have seen an unfathomable amount of reposts from Al Jazeera and MiddleEastEye, known Qatari state propaganda and major propagates of misinformation. I have always appreciated the value of institutional skepticism that embodied many of the historical and academic leftist leaders. However, right now, those values are completely thrown out in favor of Russia or Iran's geopolitical advocacy of ""everything the West does is bad"". The previous three points of behavior are certainly emboldened by the paid disinformation and bots that propagate anti-Western sentiment to destabilize Western democracy. Meanwhile, the basic interests of Palestinian civilians are left unregarded while these state operatives kill their only lifeline.
5. **Reactionary Resurgence** \- One of the main factors that attracted me to the left was its rejection of reactionary ideology(the establishment of traditional institutions from the past). For Israelis and Palestinians, reactionary rhetoric is normalized and encouraged in many cases. However, this reactionary ideology that has plagued those who share my nationality has spread to Western leftists in their advocacy for Palestine. Western leftists constantly appropriate the far-right and reactionary talking points that many radicalized Palestinians spout. An example would be the insistence on the exclusive indigeneity of Palestine from the River to the Sea, which abandons the progressive values of anti-nationalism and intersectionality. Another example would be the appropriation of Palestinian Martyrdom, in which many of them embraced the idea that human life can be inherently reduced to a political or national cause by their manner of death. This is a clear rejection of the values of individualism, secularism, and anti-nationalism.
6. **Historical Negligence** \- Those who are even a little bit informed on the Israel-Palestinian Conflict understand that the conflict is too complex to be treated as a soccer match of Israelis vs. Palestinians. Many Israeli and Palestinian leaders set roadblocks to an equitable peace, while many others progressed the conflict to a more positive state. Even more than the historical complexity of this conflict, evaluating the moral complexity requires a graduate degree in a relevant field with hundreds of hours of research. I typically advise not to trust anybody's commentary of the conflict with any less credibility than the previous sentence. However, the Western left has instead decided to follow the historical and moral analysis of demagogues. There's constantly factually wrong or misleading historical information on many of these Palestinian-sympathetic accounts. An example is the map of a ""disappearing Palestine"" that millions have reposted, a blatantly misleading map meant to depict ""Zionist colonization"", meanwhile, neglecting the historical borders of the conflict. There are many other forms of historical negligence that they commonly employ that are extremely damaging for understanding the conflict.

In conclusion, Western leftists are keeping up with the Western traditions of white saviorism and interfering with this particular trendy foreign conflict. I could have written a few more grievances that I have of the Western left(including the embracement of far-right Islamist groups) but I wanted to keep the post relatively short. In several months, Western leftists will forget about the Gazans suffering under the disproportional force of the IDF. Nobody will self-criticize the ideas or tactics that they engaged in, meanwhile, the Israeli left-wing and reliable non-Hamas Palestinian advocacy organizations are left in the dust by an ineffective white-savior-esqe Western movement. Not only that but due to all of these factors making the left look like lunatics, Biden and the Democrats are being affected in the polling, which may result in Trump being elected, a terrible outcome for Palestinians.

If you want to respond to me, **please avoid strawmanning or whataboutism**. I acknowledge that the state of Israel and Jewish-""advocacy"" organizations are partially responsible for worsening the grievances listed above. However, I know from posting on this sub before, that 50% of the comments are going to be either misrepresenting my stated position or trying to ""hypocrisy-burn"" me.

1739sut,My sister’s written documentation of the attack she was held in yesterday near Gaza,"


This is my sisters documentation of the hamas attack event she was through yesterday in Be’eri near Gaza. My sister is only 20 years old, she went to a party with her boyfriend and they  found themselves in a battlefield. She didn’t mention but I will, In these 6hours of hiding she held her hurt head friend with a towel on his wound and saved his life. When soldiers came to rescue them after six hours and asked them to take bodies from the field she performed CPR on few of them. She recognized her friends among the hundreds of bodies. Now read her documentation (which I translated using ChatGPT)


""My heart is shattered.
Yesterday morning, rockets started during the party. We quickly started to pack everything to flee as fast as we could, and then we heard gunshots from both entrances to the party. According to reports, we understood that there were terrorists on every road, and we decided to stay in the area of the party where there was police and  gunshots and our jeep was targeted. We started to flee. We were surrounded by terrorists from all directions, who kept shooting at our car. We piled up on each other in the car and tried to escape in every possible direction. We saw an IDF jeep on a hill and decided to approach it to at least be close to weapons. The jeep was abandoned and bloodied. We managed to grab some weapons found there, which turned out to be jammed, and tried to fix them while escaping. We saw our friends falling one by one to the ground from the gunshots. We managed to escape towards the fields when suddenly a group of 10 terrorists jumped us. If not for the driving skills of my partner, Dor, I don't know what would have happened to us. After about an hour of escaping from groups of terrorists and gunshots everywhere, we stopped the car to check the surroundings, understand where the gunshots were coming from, and decide the best escape route. Another group of 8 terrorists on motorcycles approached us. Two friends, Oded and Alex, couldn't get back in the car and just ran towards the fields to hide. The group kept chasing us with a barrage of bullets. A friend who sat in the back was shot in the head. Dor performed a drift, knocking down two terrorists on a motorcycle, definitely killing one. As we escaped from this group, another group started chasing us, with us having a gunshot victim in the car. The police didn't know where to direct us, and the dispatcher on the line told us to head to Ba'ari, just to make sure there were our forces at the entrance. On the way to Be’eri, another group of 4 terrorists sprayed bullets at us. We arrived at the entrance to Be’eri, and there were just bodies everywhere, no sign of our forces. We began to hear shouts in Arabic and by a miracle that only God could have made, I found a toilet that was unlocked. We hid there for about 6 hours. 
When we realized we were in a building of a Hamas cell, and they were constantly close to the toilet window and door, there were several military attempts against the terrorists in Ba'ari. After hearing them shooting and starting to sing in Arabic, we realized we were alone. We kept silent and tried to breathe quietly, spread towels on the floor to avoid any noise of movement, and prayed for our lives. The bathroom door didn't have a lock, and Dor had to hold it for 6 hours while staying close to the wall. The door was made of glass so if they tried to open it, they'd think it was locked. I and the injured person hid behind a curtain, using towels and paper to stop the bleeding and keep him conscious. The building we were in was hit by 7 RPG rockets, 3 missiles, and countless bullet sprays for 6 hours! Everything was destroyed except the small space we were in; only the ceiling and walls fell and crumbled on us. We remained silent, neither when missiles were launched at us nor during the shootings. The main thing was to stay quiet. For 6 hours, the military and all the units knew exactly where we were, but no one came. 6 hours of eternity, we couldn't believe we came out of it alive. 2 soldiers arrived from a nearby post, having escaped from terrorists themselves. We helped them carry the wounded and traumatized. The area around us was full of bodies and body parts. We loaded an unconscious but breathing man with gunshot wounds all over his body and decided to head towards the nearest checkpoint. We reached them, handed over the wounded who were taken in an armored vehicle to the hospital. We remained at the checkpoint for another 3 hours, under gunfire because it wasn't safe to go on the road, but with armed soldiers and police, it felt safer. It's an open miracle that we managed to survive and come out alive; God heard my prayers and cries. 

Although the army couldn't reach us, I'm deeply grateful. When we reached the first checkpoint and the soldier hugged me, I felt as safe as possible in a battlefield. The road was full of bodies, smoke, and abandoned cars containing bodies and parts of what was once a human being. My body still hurts from all the hits we took while driving and the debris that fell on us in hiding. The emotional pain of seeing our friends killed, countless bodies (I estimate more than 150 people dead that we saw) and several traumatized we tried to help, will never fade. We went out to dance and ended up in a battlefield. May God protect all of Israel and our soldiers. Amen. Sending strength to all the families. We will get through this 🙏.""",08/10/23 21:00:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1739sut/my_sisters_written_documentation_of_the_attack/,378,63,999,Israel,top,all

nld2lg,Majorly conflicted as a non-Zionist/Zionist Jew,"I'm 100% Jewish. I have spent the last three years studying the conflict in great detail, devoting an entire year to it at the hebrew university of jerusalem. I've studied under Palestinian Arab, Palestinian Christian, Israeli Jewish, European Jewish, and European Christian professors. I spent the last week and a half nonstop trying to write about this conflict to submit something to my university paper but every time I finish a draft I feel like it both over and under sympathizes with both sides. To put it briefly: I'm torn.

I understand that antisemitism has defined Jewish existence for the past 2000+ years: our expulsion from the Middle East, persecution in Ethiopia, genocide in Germany and pogroms in Russia are only the most recent proof of this. I understand that the only way to secure Jewish protection is through a Jewish majority state with Jewish governance.

But nothing that I've learned has justified in my mind the occupation of 5 million Palestinians. The daily tortures and miseries they have gone through in the West Bank and Gaza since the 40s is too inhumane for words. And I can't justify the fact that we deny 13 million Palestinians their right of return. After Jews were expelled, 15 distinct empires controlled that area - the Palestinian people are the amalgam of residents left behind, and possess claims to the land nearly as ancient as ours. The idea that us jews have a right of return, but palestinians do not, seems criminal to me, like we're making palestinians pay the price of suffering that had nothing to do with them.

In my mind a Confederation solution would be ideal, where two independent states are created, their border dissolved into a dotted line and residents allowed to live in either territory. A third, joint government would handle things like security, resources, and the economy. But I feel like the existing hegemony between Israel and Palestine would not be fully dissolved as long as there existed two independent states, and as long as there is a hegemony there will be violence and oppression.

I don't know. I really don't know. I don't want to be considered a liberal brown-noser by my Jewish friends and I don't want my non-jew friends to call me a colonizer. I'm sick of feeling guilty for taking up space on social media to talk about antisemitism when all of this is going on, but I'm also sick of other Jews not talking enough about the crimes Israel is committing. I don't want to feel like I have to defend Israel's colonial practices (even if you don't think it was definitionally colonialism because we too are indigenous, our forced displacement of more than 1 million indigenous palestinians was objectively experienced as colonialism).

I don't know what to make of claims that Arabs and Jews simply can't live together. It seems so vile to assume that every Palestinian is a terrorist. And it seems so reductive and racist to believe that Palestinians are merely another extension of the 'Arab Kingdom'. But our ancestors were objectively all kicked out of every Arab country within the last half century. the last of yemen's jews were literally exiled last week. it doesn't feel like it's my place to tell the children of these refugees that arabs are all good and fine to live with. but it also seems like the region will never have peace if we don't coexist in a confederation-like or secular democratic state, and israel's war crimes will only increase.

I'm just, I hate this. I live in a house of leftist athiests, there's not a lot of room for sympathy for religious ethnostates that actively oppress an indigenous population. Does anyone else feel this way????? What happens now??

1730qbn,So tired of the “Settlements are the reason” excuse,"I keep getting into discussions with pro-Palestinians that say Palestinians are justified in what they do “because of the settlements”. 

First off, most “settlements” are in Israeli controlled / disputed territory. But even more importantly, Arabs view “all of Palestine” including Israel, as Palestinian land and all Jews as settlers.

 If Israel were to dismantle every settlement today, nothing would change. In fact.

17e2djt,"Is a nuanced view possible? Pro-Israel, Anti-Netanyahu, Pro-Palestine, Anti-Hamas?","Everyone is so polarised online. I feel like views that acknowledge the pros and cons of each side are rare. 

My personal view:

- Israel has a right to exist. They DO exist. They are going nowhere. Until Palestinian leadership acknowledge this fact, no meaningful solution can found

- Hamas is a terror organisation who have shown they are war criminals and incapable of peace. There is no justification for their actions. 

- I believe that moderate Palestinians exist who would be willing to acknowledge Israel, as the PLO/PA have done in the past. Such leaders are the only possible partners in peace

- I hate Bibi intensely. He must take serious blame for weakening Israel’s democracy, inflaming tensions in Israel and in Palestine, and now, for leading Israel into what will be a long and costly war, all because he puts his own interests over the nation’s interest. I think he could prolong this war to keep himself out of jail for fraud

- Despite this, I think his policy of building relations across the Arab world was smart and must continue. If your enemy really don’t like it, you must be on to something

- Palestine has a right to exist. They DO exist, like Israel. The post-1967 War occupation of WB & Gaza was a massive mistake that should be reversed asap. Of course Gaza hasnt been occupied for 18 years and we saw how that went. And as above, Hamas must go and moderate leaders be found before any solution can occur. 

- The Free Palestine movement is full of lies and propaganda, including false claims of apartheid, genocide and war crimes. Many people who support them in western countries do so from a noble desire to help oppressed people and innocent victims, but unfortunately they also believe the many many lies (the recent hospital explosion is a good example) and the frankly anti-semitic tropes.

Last week in 8.10 the Barzilai hospital in Ashkelon was hit by a rocket fired from gaza, it's a much bigger hospital that holds far more patients, it is a level 1 hospital used for emergency treatment of patients often injured by terror attacks, and after 7.10 it was packed with both injured, dead and families of the injured.

The world was pretty much silent about it, not so much eager to lay blame and worry about the patients. 12 people were injured throughout the city during the three rocket barrages, and the hospital was hit at it's children development center that was dealt an expensive blow.

When they got to the street where my studio is located, a cvilian shot and killed them.

2 other innocent people are dead.

183h8yc,"Seriously, stop with the “genocide” claims.","The definition of genocide is:

“the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group.”

There are many prominent figures repeating again and again that Israel is committing genocide. It’s actually disgraceful. It’s an insult to the many genocides that have actually occurred in the last 50 years that no one cares about or even knows of.

Let me explain why the genocide claims are not true.

- Israel has no stated intention of committing genocide. The genocidal statements of some Israeli governments officials and representatives are not evidence of stated intention. They’re just a few peoples edgy opinions that are not carried out in a tangible way.

- Approximately 60,000 Palestinians have died since 1948, and most of the deaths have been during war periods. This averages out to about 800 per year. For reference, the Nazis killed about 1.5 million Jews per year between 1941 and 1945.

- The Palestinian population has gone up 4x since 1948. And the Gazan population has doubled since 2000.

- Israel have Gaza back in 2005. If they were hell bent on genocide, why would they do that.

- Israel supplies Gaza with free water and electricity (until recently). A very strange thing to do if you are wanting to commit genocide.

- Israel provides Palestinians with jobs and income. Another peculiar thing to do if one’s intent is to commit genocide.

- Israel has tried to offer the Palestinians their own state that they can have autonomy over. A very very ridiculous thing to do if you wanted to eradicate a nation or group of people.

- Israel provides humanitarian aid to Gazans. Furthermore, Israel built and funded a lot of the infrastructure in Gaza in the 80s and 90s to prop it up and promote health services. Weird for a genocidal country to do that.

- Death toll =/= genocide. Yes, understanding 10,000 plus Gazans have died, is not evidence of genocide. You must understand why and how they have died. Did America commit genocide against the Japanese, Iraqis, Afghans and Germans? Did England commit genocide against the Germans, Turks and Italians? No of course not. They were fighting and the unfortunate result was loss of civilians life. That is not evidence of genocide.

Yes, I’m sure you can point to a few people in the Israeli government who have said some not so smart things about solving the Palestine issue. And you can also point to bad apples in the IDF who have acted out of line and been disciplined for it. However, this is not evidence of genocide. You actually have to commit genocide to be accused of genocide. I’m also referring to Raz Segal, Owen Jones and Norman Finkelstein. Their claims are ridiculous, especially coming from University professors and I urge them to look at the many other genocides that have actually occurred and study those to understand what an actual genocide looks like.",25/11/23 10:50:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/183h8yc/seriously_stop_with_the_genocide_claims/,358,2122,502,Israel,top,all
17hq40d,An open letter to my fellow progressives,"Ripping down posters of kidnapped children, will not free Palestine, it just shows you’re an antisemite. 

Calling for the end of Israel by chanting “to the river to the sea” while people around you wave nazi flags, will not free Palestine, it just shows you’re an antisemite. 

Defending the massacre of 1,400 people, many elderly, women, and children because you think Israel deserved it, will not free Palestine, but it shows you’re an antisemite. 

If you believe the Israeli government is solely responsible for the living conditions and governing of Gaza, that has not been occupied by Israel since 2005, you might be an antisemite. 

If you’re calling Israelis and Jewish people “colonizers,” and “oppressors,” without acknowledging that Jewish people are actually indigenous to Israel, you might be an antisemite. 

If you haven’t protested against Egypt for keeping its borders closed and believe the safety of Palestinians is solely Israel’s responsibility, you might be an antisemite. 

If you believe that mass causalities caused by a brutal war automatically means it’s a genocide, you might be an antisemite.   

If you’ve never called for the release of the hostages that were brazenly kidnapped from Israel and you only care about the pain of those in Gaza, you might be an antisemite. 

Slaughtering 1,400 people in Israel — which would equate to about 42,000 Americans in comparison — will never free Palestine.

17j47i8,This is getting out of hand,"Let me preface this by saying I know what I'm about to say doesn't include all Arabs / Muslims but it has been so apparent that it's no longer the vocal minority at this point

When this started people were screaming Free Palestine saying it's because innocent people are dying

But then none of those people open their mouths when innocent people were dying in Afghanistan and in iraq, no one had hashtag free Iraq in their bio

Then the war on Ukraine happened and as an Arab, people around me in my society and on Facebook we're celebrating screaming that ""it's sinners killing sinners let God take them all""

What happened to standing with the innocent? 

So it appears that Arabs/ Muslims don't care about the innocent people in Palestine they just care about the land itself because it has religious meaning to them (it is literally connected to the judgment Day in islam, the day Palestine is free is the day of judgment for Muslims)

And then the hair that broke the donkey's back is the words ""free Palestine"" turned into an anti-semitic dog whistle.

I be scrolling randomly on tiktok or Facebook and I come upon videos that either talk about Jews/ the Holocaust, or from a Jewish creator that is not related to the conflict between Palestine and Israel in any way shape or form and I see some of the comments read free Palestine.

What does a Jewish creator that lives in America has to do with free palestine?

I'm getting fed up with people hiding behind the altruistic screams of free Palestine, free the innocent, to hide their internal racism and anti-semitism

The Muslims have always hated the Jews even before Israel was a thing and now they just have a reason to voice their hatred without criticism



Here is some proof from the Quran 

""O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies. They are allies of one another. And whoever of you takes friends with them is of them. Indeed, God May He guide the people"" (al maida 51)

""You will not find a people who believe in God and the Last Day being friendly with those who oppose God and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers, sons, or brothers. Or their clan"" [Al-Mujadila 22]

And here is what the Quran says about those that appose Islam, and in this context not believing in the Islamic god counts as opposing

""The punishment for those who wage war against God and His Messenger and strive upon earth to spread corruption is only that they be killed, or be crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off, or banished from the land.

1bqeieq,"I thought Anti-Semitism was a thing of the past, but I was so wrong.","This post started as a reply to someone who said that ""Israel is exposed to the world now""

I came to a much different conclusion after watching this conflict unfold over the last several months 

 As a middle aged Asian American man, I've experienced how bad racism can be, and so I don't think I can recover from the vile anti-Semitism I've seen from pro Palestinian supporters both here in the US, and in other countries.

I thought anti-Semitism went out with the Jim Crow laws, except for crazy neo Nazi nut bags and old fat dudes in white cloaks and hoods.

This year has been a rude awakening. Anti-Semitism is alive and well, and it is thriving.

Pro Palestinians say that they're not anti Jew, they're anti Zionist. Then why are they vandalizing Jewish owned restaurants in New York City, and marching to Jewish owned falafel shops in Philadelphia?

Do you think that Starbucks is being boycotted because corporate HQ said that the actions of one union store supporting Palestine didn't speak for the company? Or is it because the CEO Howard Schultz is a Jew?

C'mon, be honest. They don't even have Starbucks in Israel. You just don't want to support a Jewish owned business. I've seen this and been there earlier in life.I grew up in the Detroit area where people paid for raffle tickets to smash Toyotas. Life wasn't that comfortable for people who looked like me. Got told to ""go back to JAPAN!"" 

It's the same shit happening for Jews today. 
The way those racists said JAPAN is the EXACT SAME way I hear people say ""ZIONIST."" There's some extra heat in the way people say it. It's just Kike 2.0.

And it's pretty clear that a lot of people don't support a two state solution. They want the Jews in Israel gone. European settler/colonialists blah blah.

Man, I thought the Jews would have at least a century to have their own country before people who couldn't point it out on a map says it should disappear.

1aw64g2,Hamas terrorists forced families to watch loved ones get raped at gunpoint,"**TRIGGER WARNING: Most sexual assault victims of Hamas on October 7 were killed either before or during rape; several victims’ genitals were mutilated beyond recognition.**

A report analyzing numerous testimonies from the October 7 massacre specifically relating to Hamas’s sexual violence revealed that families and friends were forced by Hamas terrorists to watch their loved ones be raped and sexually assaulted at gunpoint.

The report, presented by the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel, analyzes confidential and public testimonies, eye-witness accounts, and interviews with victims, first responders and witnesses. It was sent to “decision-makers” in the United Nations to leave “no room for denial or disregard.

“The terrorist organization Hamas chose to harm Israel strategically in two clear ways – kidnapping citizens and committing sadistic sexual crimes,” said ARCCI CEO Orit Sulitzeanu. “Silence will be remembered as a historical stain on those who chose to remain silent and deny the sexual crimes committed by Hamas.”

The report revealed that Hamas terrorists threatened victims, often injured women, with weapons in order to rape them violently, often collectively with collaboration between multiple terrorists.

Partners, family, and friends were forced to watch to “increase the pain and humiliation for all present.”

Most of those sexually assaulted by Hamas terrorists were killed afterward, and some even during the act of rape. Others still were found dead later, their genitals mutilated beyond recognition or penetrated with weapons.

**The full extent of Hamas's sexual crimes will probably never be known**

The report highlighted that it cannot provide the full numerical measure of the extent of Hamas’s sexual violence, “most of which resulted in the victims' deaths, making their full extent unknown and possibly unknowable.”

The sexual assaults occurred in four main locations: At the Nova Festival, in kibbutzim, on IDF bases, and in captivity.

Severe sexual assaults were reported on multiple occasions by eye-witnesses and first responders in the Nova Festival, including group rapes. On kibbutzim, women and girls alike were brutally assaulted, including at least one case of a knife being hidden in the genital organ of one such victim.

Soldiers on IDF bases were victims of sexual violence, as well, their bodies clearly indicated. Hostages who have returned from Gaza have revealed grotesque sexual violence towards the hostages, as well.

“As the scars in our hearts refuse to heal, and the souls of our sisters and brothers cry out to us from the depths of the earth, a significant portion of those we considered partners responded in silence and denial of these horrors,” the report’s authors, Dr. Carmit Klar-Chalamish and Noga Berger, wrote. “We call on you to raise your voices and not allow the cries of these victims to fade away.”

As more and more evidence about Hamas's atrocious sexual violence comes to light, the silence of the UN, women's organizations and the entire people who call themselves ""Pro-Palestinians"" is becoming extremely loud.

What has happened in October 7 would not be tolerated by any people, any country, and Israel is obligated to make sure the Palestinians in Gaza do not have the ability to do something such as this ever again.

It is a huge tragedy yet amusing at the same time watching the ""Anti-Zionist"" crowd denying this, exactly like past generations denied or reduced past atrocities done to Jews, and even launch ""Counter"" investigations based on no evidence at all trying their absolute best to create some equivalency between raping terrorists and the IDF.

otuspm,I can't build on my land but Jews next door can,"I'm an Arab citizen of Israel and it disturbs me to a great deal that discussions regarding my equality to fellow Jewish citizens are reduced to whether I can travel on the same buses or if an Arab can run for Knesset. Even worse is that very often the standard by which our equality is judged is of itself testament to that inequality, i.e. being compared to Muslims in foreign lands instead of Jewish citizens of the same country. Meanwhile, issues that would spark unstoppable outrage in the western world have long taken a backseat to more pressing issues of crime and poverty. We have simply learned to *accept* them as reality, but they are nonetheless unforgotten and serve as a constant reminder to our inequality. One of the main issues that contributed to the formation of our identity and that understandably results in significant portions of our community identifying more strongly with the Palestinian people is the question of land.

I will use my own family as an example. My family on both my father's and mother's side (all citizens) owns land in the north located in what later became a small Jewish community settlement. We have long given up trying to get permission to build on this land or to at least have it swapped for another land by the Israel Land Authority. Meanwhile, (literally) adjacent to this land from multiple directions you will find Jewish residences. It just so happens that the Arab owned land in this area is not designated for building. To even physically access our own land is a major hassle that requires coordination with the settlement days upfront. And what about getting approved by the responsible board as members of an exclusively Jewish settlement? We have better chances at winning the lottery.

The only thing left for us to do would be to sell the land to the settlement. For this and other reasons I cannot consider myself equal in my citizenship to Jews. Certainly not when all it takes is to stand on my own land and look to my immediate right and left to experience inequality.

""Does 1M$ ferrari has a right to exist?""   
Many might have an opinion about that, except the ferrari owner itself which shouldn't care. Israel is the ferrari of the middle east at any aspect. It pushes the world into wonderful progress at any aspect. It stands at the top of the cake as a cherry of pioneering in so many aspects which older and much experinced nations have failed to mange. It shines as a diamond in innovation, sciences, tech, arts and research. Such a nation shouldn't wrestle with the question of whether it deserves to exist. It should stand as a lighthouse in the dark and If necessary, even silence anyone who ask stupid questions by it's great force.

**The Middle East Is Not Catching Up**  
The most frustrating thing in the world, even more annoying than woke students who complain about every little microaggression, is a fundamentalist who is racist, homophobic & misogynistic, but is always crying about how unjust the world is. Most people in the Middle East are in fact not politically correct at all, do not want to be, and hate the guts of anyone who is. Here is an example from real-life people who said that stuff to me:  
Jamal, Palestinian-American: ""I don't mind people being racist to their occupiers or their oppressors. It's below on my list of priorities tbh"".  
Jay, Israeli-American: ""Do not talk to me about reparations, we don't owe nobody nothing""

The thing nobody mentions when they shout out about terrorism in the f\*\*d up old people news is that people who hang around terrorists long enough become terrorists themselves. Think about it for a second, it's very hard to have an alcoholic abusive father & survive without being a little abusive yourself.

I can't tell you how many times I heard some European girl say that Israeli & Palestinian men are exactly the same. I can see that honestly, same looks, same attitude, same misogyny. I can't tell if a guy is Palestinian or Israeli before they start speaking, and if I didn't know what Arabic sounds like, no way in hell I see a difference. Those men have been living next to each other for 100 years, be enemies or friends, eventually, they become more like each other than like anybody else.

But who started this extremism path, is it Hamas when it blew up buses in the 90's? or is it extreme Israelis who killed Rabin & put Netanyahu in power? Or was it Israel when it made a third of Palestinians refugees in 1948? Or maybe it was Arabs who killed Jews in the 1930s. Or maybe it was Britain who colonized this land in the first place!?! Who gives a fuck, if you are smart, you will never play this game.

1azox35,"I'm an Israeli, and yes, I can admit I do not care about Gazans or what the world thinks.","Ok, so what I will write here might anger some people. I'm not trying to troll anyone or to provoke. I have a train of thoughts I'll try to break down to try and explain the logic behind what I'm saying, hopefully, to shed light for outsiders on what is going inside the head of a typical Israeli these days.



I see many Westerners tending to write, ""*I don't understand why I can't talk to an Israeli; they're so hard and can't listen to anything; they keep repeating the same things.*"" Yes, you are right. You can't get through. The 7 October was such a traumatic event for us that it blacked out our logic. We are irrational. We are mad. You are correct about these assumptions.

# It's all about the repressed memories of the holocaust and past wars of the Israel-Arab world.

""*Ah yes... again, the Jews whining about the holocaust, quit it*"". We can't. I am fed with this memory from age five until I'm dead. I have been to the German death camps in Poland.

I have been hearing stories every year. And not just the holocaust. The stories on the war of 1948, 1967, 1973 (probably the biggest impact here), 1982, 2006, and countless terror attacks by PLO over the years. We were constantly told that they would attack again. They will look to destroy you because you are a jew.

Horror stories about German soldiers raping Jewish women and teens, Horror stories about Arabs doing the same in 1948. Horrors from across a thousand years of Jews living in exile. Almost every nation on earth did it to us.

And yet... I, the modern Israeli Jew, listening to all these stories, and I do admit I said, ""*Nah, that's past, it won't happen again, nobody is so mad to execute it again.*"" Like what? We have the strongest military in the Middle East and the best intelligence in the region (conspiracies, please head over to /r/conspiracy); who will ever attempt to try such atrocities again?!

And then, 7 October.

At once, all these horrors erupted again. in a live stream. In modern Israel. Who have thought?! The same stories from 1940's are happening in 2023.

I was crying for a week. My whole world and beliefs collapsed. [I wrote this post just a few days after](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/176dr12/open_letter_to_hamas_and_gaza/) the 7 October. 

Looking back, it's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy:

>They will cross the border soon, and you will see what is real occupation. You will spend the coming winter in tiny tents because even Egypt refuses to help you. And there, outside the tents will stand Jewish soldiers, looking at you with empty eyes and black hearts. Making sure you won't even think about normal life anytime soon.And we won't care what the world would say.

&#x200B;

The amount of rage, fear, and repressed memories exploded so hard. The Israeli Jews have a total blackout regarding the other side. The promise ""Never again"" is true; we will pay any price to ensure it. Truly. Even at the cost of destruction and death in the size the world hasn't seen since WW2.

Yes, to some degree, we have this stupid pride to show the world - ""You don't f\*\*\* with the Jews like that ever again.""

# Why wouldn't you listen to the world? Don't you worry about sanctions? Boycotting?

Say we will agree. We'll stop and withdraw back. What the world will do to ensure it won't happen again? How \***you**\* going to solve the problem? A Palestinian state? If they will attack us again as an independent state, what will \*you\* do? Protest for Israel? How's that going to help us?

See, we don't trust you to solve it for us. Normally, I agree that scaring us off with sanctions and boycotting would do the work. But I'm (and my fellow Israelis) still fueled by the fear and memories of generations. We will endure it. Israel was almost a pariah state in the past (1970's); we can do it again. I prefer to live in security and relieve my existential fear that someone is trying to kill me because I am a jew, and being a poor and unwanted in the world.

# The death of the Israeli left-wing beliefs

You should mourn it more than anything. I am a moderate-left wing. I supported a two-state solution for a long time, but now I'm unsure what to think. There is no future for this solution.

We must face the truth and the reality of what is coming next: Gaza will drown under the iron boots of Israel. This is the bleak future waiting for both sides, as Israelis cannot trust the other side anymore. The trust went to absolute zero. There are no voices in Israel against this plan; both sides agree this is the next logical step.

I do not pity Gazans. As I do not pity Germans suffering from Allied attacks in WW2, as I do not pity any nation that is trying to kill me. The horrors and deaths Israelis have seen in the past half year are going to be deeply engraved in Jewish history for centuries to come. This is another memorial for the sad history of the Jews and their efforts to find a place under the sun.

You don't have to agree. You can still watch the region sinking into an illogical war. I just hope you can understand the Israeli emotional drive to keep fighting.

Honestly, the same could be also be said for liberal-leaning women with strong feminist values. These countries are very much anti-feminism.



Just a few additional points. 

In Gaza, it is illegal for a woman to travel without the consent of a man to do so. This was re-confirm in the courts a couple of years ago. 

In Israel, the 4th Prime Minister was a woman. If a woman could occupy the highest position of power in the entire country, nothing else really needs to be said about the right women have in Israel.

This post might be messy because I've never been more confused about my own opinions.
I hate my government for everything they have done to my people, I hate the west for their four-moth undereducated middle east activist phase, and more then anything I hate Hammas that started this blood drenched war.
I hate my government for trying to pass laws to alter the court system to help the criminal prime minister and ministers resoluting in neglection of the kibbutzim near Gaza. I hate my government for transferring money to Hammas. I hate the government for the way they fight in Gaza. Barely helping the hostages, ruining our connections to the western world, turning Israel to a third world country. Deviding our people. Dreanching our history in innocent blood. 

I hate the west (mostly of my generation) for the uneducated good for nothing activism. Turning the words Zionist, Israeli, and Jewish into insults. Not understanding anything about what it's like living in a war. I hate them for ruining my dreams. I used to be a person just like them, I had dreams of making films in Europe, films about romance and the human nature. Now I am forever bound to acknowledge my Israeli and Jewish background in anything I do. Now I will forever have to start any piece of media by saying I protested for Palestinian rights, and that I am not like my government. I used to be a normal teenager, also having my four-month activism phases for BLM and gay rights, I will never be a tiktok activist for anything. I will simply never believe them. Celebs I loved and appreciated were posting story's on insta telling their enormous audiences that they wish my home country was obliterated from existance. I used to be a normal teenager, I thought the breakup at age 15 is the worst thing to ever happen. Then the war started. I will never relate to any teenage experience again. I remember that on the 7.10, I was scrolling thru twitter in the bomb shelter to keep my mind off the boom sounds, and I saw a post saying ""the worst thing to happen to a girl is wearing a nice outfit to a shitty party"". Then I realised I truly wouldn't be able to ever relate to westners ever again. I hate the west for dumbing everything down to ""Israel or Palestine"". As if that means anything. As if this is a football match.

I hate Hammas for everything. For killing and kidnapping, for the rape and the beheading. I am making a short doco about a 12 year old girl from a kibbutz who been thru 7.10. she has been thru a holocaust. Simply no other way to explain it.

18f82ke,This war is entirely the fault of Hamas,"It’s crazy to me that Hamas attacked on October 7th. They pretty much started a war they cannot win. In doing so they caused the deaths of thousands of Palestinians. Also what’s crazy is they blame Israel for everything. For example when Israel shut off their water and power everyone was complaining that Israel was being mean and committing war crimes. How about not committing terrorist attacks on the people that supply you with power and water. Or if you really need to commit a terrorist attack, make sure you become self sufficient and supply your own water and power first.

Here’s a meme which pretty much sums up Hamas.

https://imgflip.com/i/88uny1

Honestly if Hamas actually wanted to succeed in their terrorism against Israel what they should have done is spent 50 years not attacking Israel and instead build up their society. 50 years where they set up their own infrastructure and build up their society. Start producing their own power and water. Use some of the billions they received in aid to buy fighter jets so they have some air power. 

The problem with that strategy is that terrorism relies on them having hate in their hearts and if they spent 50 years building a society they couldn’t hold that hate in their hearts. If they actually spent 50 years building a beautiful society they would actually care about their society and wouldn’t throw it away in a useless attack on Isreal.",10/12/23 17:06:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18f82ke/this_war_is_entirely_the_fault_of_hamas/,318,1909,242,Israel,top,all

1b7xcwf,"Yes. October 7th was in fact, an unprovoked medieval like raid on innocents.","My previous post in which I told the story of how the Arab world made the wrong choice on October 8th drew some pro-Hamas folks who believe that the attack was provoked.

It was not.

Hamas had been planning the attack for years with no particular scenario that'd cause it to launch this attack. October 7th was chosen not because on October 6th Israel provoked Hamas but because on October 7th there were fewer guards and Hamas knew that.  
Now, some pro-Hamas folks may argue that because Israel imposes a blockade on Gaza, that Gaza has a casus belli to attack, kidnap, rape and mutilate Israelis and western foreign nationals in southern Israel. But that's also not true. Not just because this type of medieval terrorism is not seen as legitimate by any 21st century sane human, but also because by that same logic, Israel can wake up at any day and bomb Gaza today with the same intensity of post October 7th, and claim it's a retribution for Hebron massacre in 1929. Or the DOZENS of October 7th attempts that Hamas carried out in 2023 alone up to October. Which is of course, a notion that they would reject.



But come on. Only those who do not know much about this conflict would make this argument. Historically, medieval Islamists have been attacking innocent civilian Jews with out provocation all over the region in different eras. Both pre 1948 and post 1948. You have the Hebron massacre, you have the Farhoud massacre, you have the Cairo riots, the Mouza exile, Aleppo riots 1947, and the list is endless. The persecution, abuse and terrorism that Mizrahi Jews were subjected to in the middle east is completely forgotten when discussing this conflict. Because it does not serve the Palestinian narrative in any shape or form. On the contrary, because Palestine itself historically has not been a good place for minorities -and it still is not, just ask non Muslims- this part of the history of the conflict proves why Israel is essential. Israel isn't only essential in its form but also in its idea. No minority should be subjected to what minorities are subjected to in this region. All minorities should have their own Israel. The Kurds, the Yazidis, the atheists, the Christians. Make a hundred Israels if need be, until the religious apartheid in the middle east ends. If the majority doesn't like it, well, it is not the minorities problem. Maybe the majority needs to stop deliberately worsening the minorities condition so they don't seek independence.

You can dig a dozen example of unprovoked medieval like attacks on Jews in any country in this region, in any century save for the 21st century as they had successfully cleansed their countries of all their Jews except literally handfuls.

There was never a certain ""provocation"" that sparks these medieval scenes. It's the reverse. The attacks occur, and then the search for a provocation to justify the terrorism happens.  
Not to mention that none of this is justified by international law in any case. There is no legitimate event that can be used as a ""provocation"" for attacks purely intended on civilians under fanatic religious motivation.

1bemcuj,More evidence that the Hamas death toll numbers are garbage,"[https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-791838](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-791838)

  
**Brief summary of the article:**

  
Wharton prof finds statistical anomalies in Gaza death toll numbers suggesting that they statistically can't be accurate.

1. The daily reported deaths all fall within 270+/-15%, which is statistically impossible. There should be much more variation in daily death numbers. The Hamas numbers suggest that almost the same number of people are being killed every single day.
2. There is almost no correlation between the number of deaths among women and children reported each day, which makes no sense. The lack of correlation would imply that women and children are largely separated in Gaza so that IDF strikes are killing them independently.
3. There is a strong *negative* correlation between reported deaths of men and women. While this might make some sense in that combatant men should be separated from women, the correlation is much stronger than it should be. On days when reported deaths of men were almost zero (which suggests a reporting error), the number of women killed were among their highest.
4. Hamas claims that 6000 fighters have been killed, which when combined with their reported deaths of women and children would imply that either very few non-combatant men are being killed or that almost all of the men in Gaza are Hamas fighters.

""Most likely, the Hamas ministry settled on a daily total arbitrarily,"" he concludes.

What's interesting is that this story literally didn't make the mainstream news in the West. Almost like Western media doesn't think it's important that Hamas is fabricating their death toll numbers, despite the fact that these numbers are being referred to daily as evidence for the ""Gaza genocide"" and the need for a ceasefire.",14/03/24 14:22:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bemcuj/more_evidence_that_the_hamas_death_toll_numbers/,304,502,280,Israel,top,all

1acgmqc,My sorrow. My anger. My shame. Thoughts from a 38 yo Israeli,"Background: I grew up in an upper-middle class family in Tel-Aviv, volunteered for a year in my community, served in special ops intelligence unit, moved to the US and studied at an Ivy League college, worked on wall street, and been back in Israel for several years now. 

For me Oct 7 started at 9:30am. I read about a terrorist pickup truck running free in a major town down south. I thought it was crazy but should be quickly handled by our guys. It wasn't. More and more stories broke out and I realized this time is different. The feeling was that terrorists are everywhere and the streets are unsafe. It took me almost two hours to muster the courage to leave home and head to the hospital to donate blood. The streets were completely empty and the hospital packed with doners. One guy, around 30 yo, was crying uncontrollably while waiting in the long line to give blood. I have been crying every day since that morning.    


My sorrow. A teenage girl was found dead on her bad, pants down, ejaculate on her lower back, rape wounds and a bullet hole in the back of her head. I think about her last moments in this world, her confusion turning into horror. The betrayal she felt when she realized the adult entering her bedroom wasn't a kibbutz friend but a bad guy. Daily news about dead soldiers hit me the hardest. The other day they announced the death of Noam Ashram 37 yo father of 3 from Kfar Saba. The funny guy who made the entire platoon laugh. His picture is burned in my head. That green army helmet wrapped around his graying beard, the silly look on his face. I could see myself in him. He is me. I broke down in my office in front of my meaningless numbers and graphs. He gave up hugging his kids for me. I am so sorry.   


My anger. There's a lot of anger. Where the hell was my army that morning. Why did it take them so long to deploy. Terrorist roaming around freely, raping and murdering. We failed our people. My blood boils when i think about Avigail Idan, 4 yo whose parents were murdered before she was kidnapped into Gaza (eventually released). Where were the tanks, the planes, the special forces? all this contrasts with the sheer bravery and selflessness our heroes showed once they finally arrived at the scene. I am furious with my fellow humans in Gaza. I know the list of grievances is long, I have responsibility as an Israeli and I take my share of the blame. But nothing will ever exonerate you from indoctrinating your kids to hate us. What a vile and empty way to live your lives. Where is the Gazan resistance to Hamas? where are the peaceniks? I know they'd kill any dissent but at this point what choice do you have. Choose life. In the months leading to the war I've been demonstrating against my government. Every Saturday, 40 weeks straight. Our PM gathered around him the most incompetent yes-men and women who defaulted on us in every aspect of life. They ignored the warnings, showed disdain to half the country and brought us this catastrophe. I want them all gone with shame.  


My shame. Since I came back to Israel I haven't made an effort to contact my unit and ask to be added back to the reserve list. I felt like this cat and mouse war thing was old news. I couldn't believe people still spend their time fighting instead of building better lives. I thought I was getting too old to serve anyway and hoped they'd just forget about me. I spend the first week of the war volunteering with the blood bank, thinking it would quiet my thoughts and keep me busy. Heroic stories of everyday folks rushing into fire to save strangers crushed me. The shame was simmering. What excuse do I have, being single, no kids, abled body. Shouldn't I be risking my life. It took me a whole month to call my unit. They quickly rejected me, no need for more veteran volunteers. I went with my work friends to visit leg amputees in the rehab unit. They get to live the rest of their lives with this trauma. I get to spend my time at cafes and bars like a draft dodger, fking useless.   


I think about that teenage girl. Noam Ashram, and the amputees a lot. I feel a million things, the full range of emotions. Extreme optimism to complete despair. But I'll end here.

We had nothing to do with the creation nor where we expressing support for it. Yet the Egyptian government targeted us simply for being Jews. 

My parents along with my aunt moved to USA after being expelled where I grew up most of my life. Until recently I moved to Israel last year (September 2023) as my parents thought it would be better to live with people who share the same culture and blood as us. I acquired military exemption from service due to the fact that I'm an American-Israeli dual citizen

2 weeks living in Israel, my aunt died in the October 7th massacre, rest in peace, aunt Niala :(. 
She was among the hundreds massacred by HAMAS. We heard the news a day after the massacre and me and my parents were really worried. We hoped she was okay and that she managed to escape. My aunt has been with me as I grew up. We shared a lot of moments together, and usually brought me gifts every Christmas when we were still in USA. She was there with me whenever I felt vulnerable and comforted me. I felt like a part of me died. My family was on scrambles. It was 2 days after that it was confirmed she was among the dead.

Not only that, there was even a video circulating online of a German woman named Shani Louk where her naked dead body was paraded and spat at by civilians on the streets as the phrase ""Allahu Akbar"" is repeated. They even lied that she was an IDF soldier even though she had a military exemption permit just like me. Truly one of the most terrible things you can do to a human being. This confirmed my suspicion that they will not stop until Israel is destroyed and every Jew is dead. 

Not only are the gazans praising and glorifying Hamas' ""victory"" on the attack, they are saying WE deserved it. 
This is why I'm now determined to join the Tzahal(IDF acronym in Hebrew). It's like the whole world is against us merely for existing. It's sad to say that I've become RADICALIZED. My aunt has always taught me that violence is not the answer. But I'm sorry Aunt Niala, I just can't live by that principle anymore

First, I want to say that I am an American Democrat and an Israeli leftist.  I was active in Peace Now and Meretz.  I have been in countless political debates over 30 years, and I have always stood up for the rights of Palestinians. I am well aware of the inequity in Israel, from the funding of schools to the separate roads, to the roadblocks, to settlements, and so on.  Both Palestinians and Israelis have done a lot to undermine good faith over the years- each side doing their own fair share of subversion- from Israeli continuing settlements to Palestinians blowing up busses- I could go on.  
  
But in this last round of violence, I am shocked to my core.    
  
Israel withdrew from Gaza- literally pulling and dragging the Israelis living there from their home- in order to end its occupation of Gaza.  And Israel built the iron dome to protect its citizens from rocket attacks, basically allowing them to not respond to every provocation.    
  
And Gaza got both freedom and billions of dollars of aid. Were there problems? Yes- I'm not here to completely whitewash the situation.  But I also won't say that Gaza was an “Open air prison.”  The people of Gaza had cars and a beach, sweet shops and barbers, beautiful homes and malls.  Being confined to 140 square miles does not make a prison.  
  
But over the past 16 years, Hamas has never used its money or power to build infrastructure, improve schools, or create parks.  They spend every dollar and every ounce of energy preparing for war.  They built hundreds of miles of tunnels every convenience and armed themselves with guns, rockets, night vision, and anti-tank weapons. And they quietly waited.  
  
They waited until October 7th and then attacked with all their evil fury.  They burned babies in the oven if front of their parents.  They shot children in front of their siblings.  They committed every kind of barbaric atrocity on civilians, the elderly, teenagers, small children, and babies.  
  
And before Israel could even count the number killed, there were crowds chanting in the streets “700!”  Ghouls taking glee in our murder, laughing at our pain and humiliation.  These same people now crying for a ceasefire.  
  
Why? Was it because we were “colonizers?”   Doesn’t every American live on land that was stolen from Native Americans, people that went through a REAL genocide?    
  
And how can Jews be colonizers of their original homeland?  I would say that we are a people who have been re-indginized to our native land.  And for those who would argue, “Yes, there you lost that land 2000 years ago to the Romans, there are other people living here now- get over it!” I would simply argue that under that logic- “fine you lost your land to the Jews, get over it.”  Either way, Israel is now the homeland of the Jews and we aren’t going anywhere.  
  
But what I know now is that no logic will ever reach Hamas and its supporters.  To them, the land of Palestine is Muslim land forever. They will never accept a Jewish presence in Israel. Never.  They may wait, but they will still be preparing to fight an endless battle.  
  
See, this is what I didn’t get before. I was coming at this problem as an American. What I mean is that we have certain values imprinted on our personalities.  As a Democrat or a Republican if they believe that, “people are born with certain inalienable rights, and among those rights are “life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” they will both say yes. They could disagree on every single issue, but they would agree on that.    
  
Most European countries share these enlightenment values. The French motto is “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.” Germany's motto is “Unity, Justice, and Freedom.”  We all share certain Western values, shaped by the Enlightenment.  
  
But these aren’t Hamas’s values. Not at all.  Look at this from Article 8  of the Hamas Charter.  It reiterates the Muslim Brotherhood's slogan of ""Allah is its goal, the Prophet is the model, the Qur'an its constitution, jihad its path, and death for the sake of Allah is the loftiest of its wishes.""  
  
Hamas and all radial Islam come from a place that is totally alien to us. Their goal is holy war.  They hope their children die as martyrs.   
  
So while I thought dealing with things like roadblocks and water rights would solve our problems and we could get along in peace, what I realize now is that there is no path to peace with someone whose dream is to kill you or die trying.  Literally.  
  
Meanwhile, Israel has to defend itself against the worst kind of medieval barbarism and is expected to do so with the utmost care and responsibility for every civilian.  Assad killed over 200,000 people in the Syrian Civil War? Meh, Arab on Arab crime, is not our business.  But Israel uses white phosphorous…. WAR CRIME!!!  It's not about Arab lives that drive many of you so crazy- it's that the JEWS did it some people can't stand.  
  
But what really hurts the most I think, is that Hamas fucked us in a primal way. Israel MUST keep up its defensive doctrine.  It MUST retaliate and remove its enemies, or as we know, they will be back soon.  But Hamas also took 240 hostages.  And Israel would do anything to save its citizens.  It released 1,000 prisoners to get Gilad Shalit back.  Because in Judaism, we believe in LIFE, not death. There is no garden of virgins waiting for us to die at the hands of the enemy.  
  
But we have to make a horrible choice- whether Israel says it out loud or not- retaliate and remove Hamas and sacrifice our hostages, or put down our weapons and beg for them back, allowing the savages that butcher our children to revel in victory.   
  
Of course, we have to fight or we will never be safe.  But the wound this causes on our deeply held values will never heal.  And the process is eating all of our souls and driving us insane.  So Hamas has already won in that way.  
  
All my life, I have had empathy for Palestinians. There have been wars where I have demanded a ceasefire.  There have been times I have cried for Palestinian pain—no more.  
  
Perhaps the worst wound of this war is that I can no longer have empathy for the people of Gaza.  I don’t have the heart or the emotional space to grieve for our families, our children, our kidnapped hostages- and feel pain for the poor innocent Palestinian child.  That died in me, and for that I blame Hamas.    
  
Where a huge crater opened up in the earth after a bombing today, I shrugged.  This is war.  This is what Hamas wanted.  They begged for us to enter Gaza with our full rage.  People are going to die.  You don’t like it now?  Too fucking bad. Could have made a different decision on October 6th.  Honestly, why are people complaining about Israel’s response?  We are just doing exactly what Hamas asked us to do!  
  
To those who support us in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United States, everywhere- thank you for your support.  It means the world to us.  
  
To those of you with your intersectionality, your colonial narrative, your faux intellectual liberalism, your both side-ism- wake up and take a good look at the world. You are next.  “Gay for Hamas?”  You could be having a great time in Israel but you choose to be lynched or thrown off a building. Dumb assess.  
  
For those of you who are just good old-fashioned antisemites, thank you for your honesty. At least you are better than the phony bitches who hide their antisemitism behind pretend ethics. Nevertheless, you are vile, despicable, and evil.  I hope you don’t wake up in the morning.  
  
Just understand this, all of you.  We Jews are lovers of peace and life.  We also have enlightenment values.  We just want our tiny ancient homeland to grow fruits and vegetables, have a TV, a car, and a couch.  We want to sing and dance.  We don’t think you need to be Jewish to be a good person. We aren’t trying to trick you, own you, manipulate you, take your land… nothing. We want to be left alone to live in dignity as a people deserving a place in this world.  
  
But if you don’t deserve a home, don’t deserve respect, don’t deserve dignity… if you cheer for our murder, or criticize us for defending our homeland- you need to know that we will fight for our survival, and we won't apologize for it.  
  
When Hamas has been eradicated, I look forward to working towards peace with our arab neighbors- all of them.  I still dream of peace. But not until Hamas is destroyed to the man, no matter what the cost.  This is what Hamas has done to me.

17w6s3h,I'm far left and I stand with Israel,"It hugely confuses me why the anti Israel side are considered left wing. 
I support women's equality, trans rights, gay rights, and religious freedom. 
Isn't that what the left is supposed to be about? Tolerance and equality? 

I'm genuinely baffled, are Hamas considered the left wing option in this war? The side that is horrible to women, LGBT people and Jews while Israel has the best LGBT and women's rights in the middle east and Arabs have equal rights. 
Yes, Netanyahu is right wing but you can't get more far right, more unequal, more intolerant, more reactionary than hamas.

Where are the leftists outraged by the treatment of women, Jews and LGBT people all over the middle east? Where are the mass protests? 
Why are so many leftists on the side of Russia and china? Russia's LGBT rights are horrendous, there's mass inequality and china is similar.",15/11/23 23:05:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17w6s3h/im_far_left_and_i_stand_with_israel/,295,575,147,Israel,top,all
nf47yp,Lets fight some propaganda.,"1. Gaza Strip is like the Warsaw Ghetto.
   1. No, It's not -- the Warsaw ghetto had 465,000 people live in 1.3 sq miles. Gaza Strip has 2 million people living in 141 sq miles. That means in a land mass that is 108 times larger, with a population 5 times as large. I've seen this multiple times. It makes no sense and is not a serious argument.
2. Ceasefires
   1. Hamas likes to break ceasefires over and over and doesn't truly respect them. 2014 War saw Hamas break 4 or 5 ceasefires, including the final ceasefire terms, where rockets were still fired into Israel after. 
   2. There's different types of ceasefires -- UN ones are for humanitarian reasons (probably to allow aid workers in), US ones side with Israel to keep blowing up stuff like tunnels, usually and Egyptian ones were to negotiate an end to the war in 2014. Which neither side listened to.
3. The war is about settlements.
   1. No, it's not. The war is in response to the perceived threat at Al Aqsa, which is the video which made Arabs in Israel riot and Hamas to start firing rockets at a rapid clip. American leftists have claimed this war is about settlements and evictions, but there's no reason to believe this, Al Aqsa is the symbol of Islam within Israel and Hamas, an islamist party, has a desire to be seen as a defender of Islam in the Holy Land, to a fault. 
   2. If ever there were peace talks, those peace talks would center around Israeli incursions into the West Bank. But that's not what this war's really about, Israeli settlements are like Hamas rockets, it happens in peace and war time, with no sign of abatement coming. 
4. Tunnels
   1. Tunnels, full stop, exist in Gaza for the purpose of war and smuggling. What we speak of are multimillion dollar tunnel operations underneath homes and schools. They were the issue of the 2014 War, where Hamas built them for troops to emerge on the other side, and are still at issue today. 
   2. I had someone actually tell me Palestinians sleep in these tunnels because Gaza is crowded. There's nothing to suggest this, Palestinians are poor in Gaza, this is true, but there's nothing to suggest that they sleep underground in multimillion dollar tunnels underneath other people's houses which magically end around the Israeli border. This is real life, not the movie Metropolis.
5. Is the video of Al Aqsa under attack faked? 
   1. Now that I have your attention, can anyone speak on this? I don't know if the video is faked or what's occurring is a projection of Al Aqsa under attack. 
   2. Like I don't doubt the events occurring in the video, where Israeli police clear the way for Jews to make their way to the wall, but did Israel really attack protesters in the mosque as alleged? I have not seen credible sources saying they did, this has really become secondary.
6. War Crimes
   1. Both sides commit war crimes, it's important to understand this is a propaganda tool used on both sides and has been in several conflicts before this. 
7. Hamas is not at issue
   1. Umm, well, how? Fatah's not under attack and it's like the third war where almost all the action's in Gaza, even as Israelis grab land in the West Bank.

Okay some pro-Israel ones while I'm here.

1. Israeli settlements are peaceful
   1. No, they're not, the history of Hebron details many instances where Israelis use the power of the state as a way to cover for murder. 
2. There's no issues with Israeli police
   1. Wrong, Ethiopian Jews say that Israel's police racially profiles them and they're separate from the conflict entirely. 
3. Hamas is who instigated this war
   1. No, not true, this war was probably brought on by the Israeli right wing's taunting of Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, which escalated up until the point where the video of Al Aqsa under attack happened, which was a fuse to the tinderbox of the whole situation
4. Joe Biden is inherently at fault for not being more pro-Palestinian and Bernie Sanders is much different from he.
   1. No, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden fundamentally believe in the same position -- their needs to be two states to solve the crisis. One is more vocal in calling out as Israel as apartheid and is more militant in believing Israel must find a diplomatic answer. But they believe in the exact same thing otherwise and you won't find someone who truly believes the contrary with any power in America, save Ilhan Omar. 
5. Israel is apartheid
   1. Fundamental to understanding this position is to understand what Palestinians want.
      1. Palestinians do not make a claim for wanting to create an Israel which would allow equality to an Israeli but to create a completely separate state -- one which would be largely homogenous in racial composition. And one which would perhaps match the position they had while Jordan controlled the West Bank. 
      2. This means they want separate but equal citizenship in the same land. One where they are subject to their laws, etc. One which matches the call for self determination and autonomy. And one which is consistent with the idea of creating a Nation-state.
      3. Nelson Mandela DID NOT want this, he sought to create a system which would EQUALIZE the rights of the white person with the right of the Black person in South Africa. He was part of the creation of a constitution which enfranchised black people to the same status of the white person. PALESTINIANS DO NOT WANT THIS.
      4. In Israel today, ONLY ONE THING SEPARATES THAT OF A PALESTINIAN AND ISRAELI (outside subjection to casual and state racism) which would indicate a Palestinian is not equal to an Israeli: The right of return. 
      5. Outside this, Muslim Israelis are not denied any other rights in Israel. They can vote, own businesses and property. They can become members of Knesset. And do!
      6. So please understand: the challenge of Apartheid is of relevance to Israel's current situation but also a distortion -- Palestinians CHOOSE a new form of apartheid as a way to self determine. No one asks for pacificsm and equality but to create a separate system entirely.",18/05/21 07:26:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nf47yp/lets_fight_some_propaganda/,300,356,1061,Israel,top,all
173m9a8,Rant from my perspective,"I am a 14 year old kid, from the safer part of israel from Gaza. On the 7th I woke up at 6:00 in the morning to sirens, I was barely awake and in such a panic I forgot to get my dog to the safe room. The news aren’t out yet, so I’m waiting on that. Few hours pass, seems fine, I check the internet and there’s a war between hamas and israel. Now I’m heavily opinionated. My opinions align more with the IDF’s, since I live here, I may be a bit biased but still everything I claim here is out of sources. I check Twitter for “israel”(it’s trending) and oh my god. Hundreds of videos of poor captured soldiers in Gaza, being spit on, hit, video of a girl in Gaza, getting taken out of a truck, her bottom part being very much bleeding through her pants from being raped. I already wasn’t a supporter of palestine, but this made me hate them. I understand the civilians don’t want this, but Palestines government supports what hamas is doing. I see the comments on that video “free palestine” left and right. You saw this disgusting video and you still said free palestine? What the fck. These hamas members are not human. They’re animals. Videos of families kidnapped. Coming into homes and shooting kids, old people. But at the end of the day hamas kills more Palestinians than it does Jews and these “pro Palestinians” still support that? Those blind people who can only scream free palestine as their argument? Israel offered peace again and again. Now there’s no other choice. Israel can only defend itself. If you’re against celebrities supporting israel, you’re a rape supporter.",09/10/23 07:55:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/173m9a8/rant_from_my_perspective/,296,125,287,Israel,top,all
1bbtb9e,"I admit to being radicalized, and I don't think I'm sorry either. A rant of an Uppity Jew","I look forward to an open and honest discussion here, but I will not entertain a lecture. I'm not the bad guy for daring to suggest that one side, which [largely wants to slaughter the Jewish people](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/poll-shows-palestinians-back-oct-7-attack-israel-support-hamas-rises-2023-12-14/), is less legitimate than my own. Wag your finger at me all you want; I'll wag mine right back at you. I don't accept smarmy tone policing.

Recently, I received significant pushback in one of my social circles; one that I thought was “reasonable” on the conflict. How come? What was my crime? My crime was pointing out that yes, the data shows that a large majority of Palestinians in the territories said [October 7th was a good thing.](https://www.jta.org/2023/12/20/politics/a-poll-shows-palestinians-overwhelmingly-support-oct-7-what-does-that-mean) And that maybe Israelis aren't wrong to feel suspicious about their neighbors after being constantly attacked. For this, I was accused of ""racism"" and ""war crime apologia.""

Based on all that, I suggested that the disingenuous mainstream narrative of ""Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinian people"" is misleading and incorrect. Hamas may not represent ALL Palestinians, but when [SEVENTY TWO PERCENT](https://www.jta.org/2023/12/20/politics/a-poll-shows-palestinians-overwhelmingly-support-oct-7-what-does-that-mean) said their actions on October 7th were good, there's a major problem here. A majority is a majority. Don't gaslight me and tell me that what I can see with my own eyes isn't real. Even President Biden, who I had a lot of respect for, [got in on the lies and gaslighting](https://www.israeltoday.co.il/read/fact-check-biden-says-hamas-doesnt-represent-palestinians-is-that-true/). Two plus two doesn't equal five even if you insist upon it very strongly. I will not repeat [vranyo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vranyo) propagandist lies which I know deny reality just so the crowd doesn't hurt the ""uppity Jew"" who gets out of line.
What am I expected to do? Deny statistics and pretend that the opposition wants flowers and rainbows? The people on the farthest left in Israel are [now coming to recognize](https://www.timesofisrael.com/their-dovish-hopes-clipped-some-gaza-border-residents-make-peace-with-becoming-hawks/) that there is no peace with a people who deny you the simple right of existence. If I, as a narishe little New York Jew, am feeling radicalized over the situation, imagine how actual Israelis feel. I have a relative who was aching to join a combat unit, but he couldn't because as an only child his parents wouldn't sign a waiver. He fumes about it to this day. He was a dove on October 6th.  Now he's changed permanently.

Yeah, I'm radicalized. I am. Is it an issue? Maybe. But I don't feel sorry for it. The entire world is lying to the Jewish people and propagandizing them into accepting their own slaughter. I feel somewhat more offended at the people who lie about the goodwill of our opposition than those who openly state they want us to die.

People don't understand the depths of the betrayal that occurred on October 7th. Peace definitively died that day. Palestinians killed it. The people in the Gaza envelope were socialist kibbutzniks. They were the most fervent about peace. But then Hamas slaughtered them, and the people of Gaza clapped for the murderers. Where are the peaceniks now?

I will not deny reality for the sake of peoples' feelings. I will not toe the party line out of fear of losing goyish friends. Fuck that. I'm a Jew and I'll surround myself with my people.

No, I'm not going to vote for Trump. This isn't some idiotic ""Why I Left the Left"" Dave Rubin arc. I have no agenda to grift. Fascism and dictatorship is still not the way.

And I still oppose settlements and the right wing and all the narish they stand for, because even if Palestinians are the main obstacle to peace, becoming a reactionary monster is not the answer.

But what is the answer? The answer is telling the truth. The answer is standing up for the truth even if it's hard. That's what Jews are known for and will continue to be known for in the future. It's who we are.

No, I don't think ALL Palestinians are bad. No, I don't want to force annexation on them. All I'm saying is that I will start supporting peace when they do. And I will put my guard down when they do.

But I do admit to feeling more upset when my people are killed than when theirs are. Am I inhuman now? Soulless? **Will I be lectured about having a soul when the other side rejoices as they slaughter us?**

I'm open to having a discussion and I'm open to being talked down. **But do not ignore facts, and do not throw out ad hominem to catch a cheap win.** I truly believe that the entire world despises us. Of course there are exceptions, yet the general rule stands.

1awie47,A Gazan got Israeli residency after saving Israeli soldiers on October 7th- a discussion,"[https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/sjajzwx2t#autoplay](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/sjajzwx2t#autoplay)



sorry it's in hebrew, but I will translate:

Hamid Abu Arar, a Palestinian and a father of 9 from Gaza, got today a residency in Israel after saving Israeli lives on October 7th.

Hamid was working in agriculture and on the morning of October 7th his pregnant wife Fatma drove both him and another guy who worked with him to work, they got into an intersection and when they stopped to let other vehicles through terrorists on motorcycles surrounded them.

The terrorists shot and killed his wife Fatma and their unborn child and the fellow worker that was in the car with them, they also injured him and his 7month baby who was in the car with them.

for hours he had to hide with his baby, he called Israeli emergency lines but no one could reach them because of the major amount of terrorists, the baby and him hid in an Electrical case for five and a half hours.

after five and a half hours he tells that the Hamas terrorists came and stood outside of the case, he heard them talking about ambushing soliders, a few minutes later he heard voices in Hebrew, he peaked outside and saw Israeli soliders. He was scared of the shooting battle that would happen between both groups but decided he has nothing to lose- the terrorists started to shot towards the soliders from unknown hiding place.

Hamid stripped down and went outside of his hiding with his baby towards the soliders, told them there were 4 terrorists and explained where they were hiding , him and the baby waited another hour and a half before they were evacuated to safety.

&#x200B;

I find it wholesome to see, a Palastinian father so worried about his child but still having the bravery to do what's right for him and his son.

Also so shocked from what Hamas terrorists were capeable of- the amount of arabs, muslims, beduim and even Gazan workers murdered brutally by them is horrific, sadly it doesn't end for the Palastinians in Gaza rn- still being terrorized by Hamas.

hopefully people like that are the future of the Palastinian people and their cause, making a wholesome and peaceful country, caring about their own children and family.

welcome to Israel Hamid :).",21/02/24 17:49:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1awie47/a_gazan_got_israeli_residency_after_saving/,284,167,381,Israel,top,all
1btinvo,10/7 is 9/11,"I want to start by saying I’m not taking either side, this is not about that. This is about similarities I’ve personally noticed that I can’t seem to find anyone posting about. Granted, there may be a reason for that so this post might be taken down before anyone can see it. However, I’m still going to try because I can’t be the only one noticing these things…..

October 7 is September 11th…not just in a DejaVu way but like a replay, play by play way. 

* Both had attacks that are now referred to by the date (just something I noticed). 

* Both have the strongest most advanced military yet both completely lacked to secure their country on the day of the attacks, and were completely vulnerable in such a way where the door was wide open for attacks, with very little military pushback. Coincidentally of course.

* Both had prior warnings and knowledge about the attacks 

* Both were attacked by groups that are listed as foreign terrorist organizations. 
* Both resulted in thousands of deaths as a result of the attacks. 
* Both had the ability to backtrack each step these terrorist took down the the second (9/11 was the terrorist passports that miraculously survived the fire that melted steel, along with video and phone surveillance…10/7 was the go pro’s the men wore on their chest, recording every second).  
* Both had a VERY VERY delayed military response time (both don’t seem to know how to scramble jets either)
* Both attacks were “successful” by the terrorist
* Both terrorist groups were very small and low budget, no Air Force etc…
* Both terrorist groups did not possess the capability of these attacks
* Both countries rallied the world around the concept of this being about their ‘patriotism’ and sending a message this can never happen again, declaring war and dropping bombs within a week. 
* Both countries leadership completely disregarded what their own people wanted and made decisions themselves (President Bush launched both invasions, Afghanistan and Iraq, WITHOUT congressional approval) 
* Both have too many similarities to even list

And of course, the relationship between Israel and America is another odd factor, being so close and unconditionally supportive of the other as if they are the  same country. Who can tell the difference at this point? 

Lastly, the full death toll in the U.S. led invasions of Afghanistan AND Iraq was in the millions, around 4.5 million….looking for ONE man. 

Rumor has it that this same man was funded, armed, trained and indoctrinated by the CIA which of course, the CIA denies. (Good thing they NEVER lie….or kills their own president)

I guess I can’t help but notice the obvious that history is repeating itself, in real time for the world to see. Play by play. Just this time we have technology on our side…making any cover up attempt impossible which seems to be an essential factor needed for this (well, I guess needed for buying time I should say…)

More importantly, MOST importantly……who really is Hamas? 




When I speak about the war and speak on military action that happened with/after 9/11, I’m referring to the leadership and the leadership only. The corrupt ass politicians that are pulling the strings behind their comfy desk and bags of insider trading money who never actually witness first hand any of the carnage and destruction their decisions result in. They are the ones at fault and the ones to blame, and everyone knows this. I think corrupt politicians are the most dangerous people that exist…

Although when it comes to Bush I feel he’s sorta on the same level as Biden as far as intelligence and coherence goes, and merely just a pawn that acts as a mouthpiece but has no authority what so ever behind the scenes…(although bush does have one impressive skill which the dude has cat like reflexes when a shoe is suddenly thrown at him) 

But this is what makes me have even more respect for those who served during this time, because they are the ones who had no choice and got thrown right in the middle of war without warning, and they had to fight regardless if they trusted our leadership or not and regardless of their own politics and regardless of their own personal opinions and beliefs. 

I guess my point of this post was just to point some oddly similar things between the two situations, which there are a lot of them. Too many.",01/04/24 23:00:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1btinvo/107_is_911/,288,371,753,Israel,top,all
1b90pfl,I think there’s an anti semitism problem in the pro Palestine circles that should be addressed ,"I don’t believe every pro Palestine person or pro Palestinian for that matter is anti semitic. I think what’s going in Gaza is horrific and seeing the images coming out of Gaza is heartbreaking and I don’t think children should have to experience this. With that being said, the every pro Palestine person is anti semitic charge can be overblown but the anti semitism and anti Israeli sentiment I see and problematic slogans really don’t help with dispelling the anti semitism charges. 

We saw a number of rallies show support for October 7th before Israel even responded. I see signs that talk about resistance by any means necessary, intifada revolution which harmed Israelis and wanting all Palestinian prisoners released or attacking a person with an anti Hamas sign.  On Twitter I’ve seen people mock the hostages, deny that they were raped or can Hamas a resistance group or call for ethnic cleansing of Israelis or being racist towards Israelis. The anti Zionist Jews they like to spotlight have problematic views and are anti semitic (Norman Finklestein, the negurei karta Jews etc) 

There was an account on Twitter I saw that I knew was anti semitic (posted the khazar theory, Israel did 9/11, Zionism to replace Jews) as soon as she posted holocaust denial all of a sudden people who are pro Palestine realized that she was bad. It took holocaust denial for people to condemn her. I’ve seen celebrities getting called out and getting shit for their pro Israel positions (any shumer, Noah schapp) or people like Lana del ray for wanting the hostages released yet celebrities who are pro Hamas (Mia Khalifa, Amanda Seeles) or anti semitism from John Crusack, Macklemore don’t get a peep from pro Palestine people but things pro Israel people have said get put out there and if you criticize anti semitic YouTube streamers or other people I see tweets telling people to leave them alone. 

The pro Palestine movement can be thriving but they don’t elevate Palestinian peace activists or Israelis that want peace but instead choose to let anti semitism slide in their movement without distancing themselves from the radicals and wonder why the anti semitism charges get used a lot.

174cnyt,Many Palestinians do support Hamas and acts of terrorism,"People keep saying 'Civilian Palestinians are different and are different than Hamas' or that 'Israel  attacks innocent civilians' when in reality those civilians, including teenagers, support Hamas and praise their acts.

It pisses me off to see people being so naive.

According to polls more than 50% of Palestinians in Gaza and other Israel regions support Hamas:

That's and extremely large number. If there was a Palestinian state, you know who would the leader be tomorrow.

You can also see it in protests around the world today how the free palestine people just ignore the Israeli victims and are supporting Hamas actions.

You can see that Hamas members are bringing hostages to the city and many Palestinians, including those teenagers which you always blame Israel for arresting them,  are surrounding the truck and filming these disgusting scenes. Come on man, this is 2023. You can't pretend to want your own land while engage in barbaric actions such as this. Those children and men are either brainwashed or actually believe in these acts of evil.

I am Iranian and know well that the regime in Iran used CHILDREN to intimate/attack protesters. Hamas and Palestinians seems to be the same. They use children as tools. This is the ugly side of war. If the next protests in Iran arises and 16 year old kids start shooting people, you can't expect Iranians to not defend themselves.  

What I haven't seen though is Israeli soldiers arresting, kidnapping, raping women and children and executing after while Israeli citizens and children watching them. That just proves the difference between the two sides of war.

If you can't identify evil, you are evil yourself or you tell yourself lies to sleep at night. ",10/10/23 04:38:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/174cnyt/many_palestinians_do_support_hamas_and_acts_of/,290,247,302,Israel,top,all
nhxnni,Free Palestine,"Just came from pro-Palestine demonstration here in Czech Republic, which was infront of Israeli Embassy. Just went there to check whats going on and experience such a demonstration on my own. 

Stood there and looked at the chanting and people on both sides. 

One of the chants was :""Free Palestine, from the river to the sea"" 

As i understand, river=Jordan, sea=Mediterranean. 

Now, it got me thinking. What does it even mean? 
Erasing Israel and creating a Palestine instead? 

If thats the case. Isnt it unreal? I mean there were banners with ""Stop the killing in Gaza"". That is a logical and realistic wish. Some other banners were pointing to take some action that make sense kinda. ""Stop killing childer"" ""Occupation is evil"", etc...

But Free Palestine, seems like symbolic chant that seems useless. Its just impossible that Israel will be erased. This looks to me actually like very harmful chant to Palestinians themselfs. It doesnt bring anything on the table. No solution. No idea. Nothing cant be done with it and just keeps the status quo, where a lot of Palestinians live a terrible life. Or i just dont understand it? Anyone can give more info whats behind this chant?",21/05/21 17:11:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nhxnni/free_palestine/,286,407,200,Israel,top,all
1bvqgqu,The fantasy idea of destroying Israel irreparably damages the Palestinian cause,"If you look at leftist and Palestinian discourse online and at universities, there's a seeming obsession with destroying Israel. Either through decolonization, military force, or the ambitious idea that Israel will become so ostracized from the international community that it will essentially dissolve itself.

The problem with this train of thought, aside from the fact that it's based more in fantasy than reality, is that it prevents practical solutions towards peace from emerging. 

Why, after all, would Palestinians support a 2-state solution when the idea of destroying Israel altogether and taking over all the land is a seeming reality? Far from an extremist point of view, you see this regularly parroted by prominent leftist figures like Bree Newsome. 

And far from speculation, this is what played out exactly with Arafat walking away from peace in 2000. Recently, a close advisor to Arafat did an interview with a Saudi Arabian newspaper where he said that many of Arafat's advisers were FURIOUS with him for walking away from a peace deal, while adding that he did so because he was unable to come to grips with the fact that the Palestinian fight for liberation would end with a peace treaty with necessary compromises as opposed to a heroic victory on the battlefield.

This mindset is precisely why you see people angrily chanting ""from the river to the sea!"" instead of something more practical/peace-oriented like ""2 states for 2 people."" It's why 75% of people in the west bank reportedly support the actions of Hamas on 10/7. When you believe the lie that destruction of israel is an inevitability, the motivation to make peace takes a back seat to violent resistance.

Further, the ongoing demonization of Israel with opinions masquerading as facts (i.e Israel wants to kill every Gazan and is planning to put up fancy condos all over the Gaza coast) achieves a similar effect. If Israel is portrayed as the epitome of evil (as it tries to get its stolen civillians back and for Hamas to surrender), the idea of making peace with Israel becomes something to avoid rather than pursue.

As someone eloquently said recently: 

To bet on and advocate for Israel's destruction as opposed to pursuing peace is ""to perpetuate one of the gravest series of strategic errors of the last century.  The cost of this error is generations of broken dreams, misdirected efforts, and rivers of blood.    
Again and again, the bet is concentrated on a single black tile.  And yet the entire roulette wheel runs red.  
Look at Israel in 1948, and look at Israel today.  Look at what was achieved.  
Look at the condition of the Arabs of Gaza from 1948 to today.    
And look at the condition of the Arabs of Haifa from 1948 today.  
For ""friends"" of the Palestinians to encourage not a strategic pivot, but a strategic doubling down, and a stoking of hatreds, is not the act of a friend.    
It is to consign Palestinians to suffering without end.""",04/04/24 15:43:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bvqgqu/the_fantasy_idea_of_destroying_israel_irreparably/,281,688,497,Israel,top,all

The „Experts“ of Hamas and Al Jazeera (based in a pro Hamas country) failed to mention how quick Hamas blamed Israel, how often their rockets fail and how much of the detonation side shows evidence for a failed missile by forces from inside Gaza.

There will be people who wont believe US media, but the evidence is pretty clear and WSJ did a way better analysis than Al Jazeera.

nh3la6,15% of rockets launched in Gaza land in Gaza.,"According to the latest stat from the IAF it appears out of the 4070 rockets launched towards Israel about 610 of the them landed in Gaza.

https://twitter.com/IAFsite/status/1395241588943736832

My question is this... We know that there are a lot of civilian deaths in Gaza and the numbers we get are from the Gaza health authority . How many of these deaths have been caused by  ""friendly fire"" ?

It just strikes me as odd that Israel goes out of its way to use precision weapons to avoid collateral Damage. They send notices they day before they take out a building... So why are there so many civilian deaths?

yes there are mess-ups like the 50 that were killed when a Hamas tunnel network collapsed.

I guess I am suggesting that the 610 rockets that Hamas used on its own people should account for a percentage of the deaths. 

With the Global media Bias is seems they are just taking the health authority word that all deaths are due to the IAF and that just sounds to me like Lazy Journalism trying to effect a narrative to the public.",20/05/21 15:44:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nh3la6/15_of_rockets_launched_in_gaza_land_in_gaza/,282,326,187,Israel,top,all

173dhf6,Your terrorism is showing,"First, as someone who has lived and studied in both Israel and Palestine (and has friends and family in both) it is abhorrent to see social media warriors make blanket statements about an incredibly nuanced conflict. I believe that unless you have spent considerable time in this region, you do not have an informed opinion and you should not be contributing to these discussions. In a situation where religion, history, culture, and terrorism are all huge factors, these discussions can not be taken lightly. You are contributing to an already lethal situation by spouting your uninformed Instagram opinions. 

Second, Hamas ≠ Palestine and Palestine ≠ Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist organization. Hamas’s primary goal is the eradication of all Jews on this planet (starting with the Jewish state). By saying you are in support of the Hamas terrorist attack, you are supporting terrorism—not Palestine. 

Third, saying you are not anti-Jewish but are anti-Israel is a terrifyingly ignorant statement to make. Every religion on this planet has a home base in which they can freely and safely practice their religion. Muslims have Mecca. Christians have the Vatican City. The Jews lacked even the idea of a state until the British Balfour declaration of 1917. Israel is the Jewish state. Whether you agree with that or support it is another story, but that is a fact. Saying you are anti-Israel has the same meaning as being an antisemite. 

Fourth, you can be pro-Palestine and pro-Israel. Supporting one does not mean you denounce the other. 

I genuinely believe education and lived experiences are key in this battle. Obviously don’t hop on a flight right now, but when you can, spend time in both areas then feel free to spew any opinion you resonate with.

We, Arabs, are our own worst enemies. 

We, Arabs, are our greatest oppressors.

We, Arabs, have killed and oppressed a million times more of our people than the West and Israel can ever do.

It is not Israel that married off my mother when she was a child. It is my people who did.

It is not the West or Israel that has been bombing Yemen for the past decade and killed 400,000. It is us, Arabs, who did it.

It is not the Israel that implanted Islamic extremism in the East and the West. It is our mosques, it is the books we worship, it is the Imams we follow, it is what we learn and what we teach.

It is not the West that forces us to treat women like commodities. It is our people.

And most of all, it is not the West or Israel that doesn’t value Arab lives. 

It is us, Arabs, who do not value human life.

If we do not admit to ourselves that WE are the problem, that WE are refusing to progress, and that WE need to change – then change will never happen, blood will keep flowing, and we will never know peace.

ic1d44,You might be an anti-Semite if...,"1. You might be an anti-Semite if you describe Israel as the ""only"" country in the world which occupies, genocides, discriminates, displaces or otherwise does inhumane things, or at least the only country in the world we should be focused on, to the point where a stance on Israel is a core partisan issue in many countries not even in that region. You don't care about atrocities happening in other places in the world, even if they have orders of magnitude more death and destruction than in Israel, hell, even if they're happening to Palestinians, and you say pro-Israelis bringing other issues up is ""distracting from the REAL issue of Israel"". The only country you ever call ""illegitimate"" or ""an apartheid"" is Israel.
2. You might be an anti-Semite if you think Israel is the worst country to have ever existed and refuse to even consider other countries for that title, including those committing crimes against humanity on a much, much higher scale, both in terms of the amount of people affected and the depravity of their actions. You prioritize addressing the Palestinian problem before every other problem in the world, and act like all of the millions of people dying all around the world pale in comparison to the thousands that died or were displaced in the past century. You only worry about the Jewish state.
3. You might be an anti-Semite if you say that there is little difference between what the Nazis did to Jews and the policies of Israel towards the Palestinians. This can only be either a very malicious anti-Semitic attack to simultaneously minimize the utter horrors the Nazis have done to innocent Jews and inflate the Israeli-Palestinian situation to a monstrous mischaracterization, or an unbelievably ignorant opinion that makes it clear you know nothing about the Holocaust nor about Israel.
4. You might be an anti-Semite if you think Israel is trying to steal land and stopping at nothing to achieve that, despite Israel having [no incentive whatsoever](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/d00r9s/what_does_israel_stand_to_gain/) to do so, and in fact having a MASSIVE negative incentive. You think IDF soldiers are remorseless and see no problem killing Palestinian children, even though the IDF has every incentive AGAINST that. Essentially, you just think Israelis are equivalent to non-human leeches with no concept of morality.
5. You might be an anti-Semite if you think it is the goal of all Jews to control or destroy the Al Aqsa mosque. For the record, there used to be the Jewish temple right near where Al Aqsa is now. When Jews want to pray on the western wall, there is nothing about that to suggest they are ""trying to provoke Muslims and take control of the mosque"". Spreading these conspiracy theories or denying that there ever was a Jewish temple there, is clearly anti-Semitic.
6. You might be an anti-Semite if you don't like how the Holocaust is ""used"" to try and ensure protection for Jews. You also think ""Jewish groups"" have too much power in the west. You want the world to forget about the Holocaust as much as possible, stop holding people accountable for Jewish persecution and instead move on to more relevant topics. Then you wonder why people overuse the term ""Nazi"" in situations where it's not applicable...
7. You might be an anti-Semite if you don't like Israelis and Jews bringing up attacks against Israelis, attacks on Jews, anti-Semites disguised as anti-Israelis, unjust and disproportional discrimination and bigotry Jews and Israelis are subjected to. You say you agree that anti-Semitism and bigotry are bad, but you don't like how much attention activists against anti-Semitism are getting.
8. You might be an anti-Semite if you blame Jewish suffering and pogroms against them completely on the Zionist movement, even in countries where the Zionist movement had no local impact like middle eastern and north African countries, or even before the Zionist movement was significant, like during the 19th century and before.
9. You might be an anti-Semite if you refuse to acknowledge that Jews were persecuted in Muslim countries, let alone that they were exiled and had all of their property seized in 1948. You insist that Jews could live just fine in any Muslim country today, as if we're still living in the Islamic golden age and not in an age where all minorities suffer immensely in most Muslim countries.
10. You might be an anti-Semite if you claim Jews used to live in peace in Palestine (and in other Muslim countries) in the past, so they should just stop complaining now and agree to live under Palestinian rule. You think there literally could never be any problem with that.
11. You might be an anti-Semite if you don't care what happens to Jews if Palestine is ""freed from the river to the sea"", or if they are ""deported back"" to Europe or the middle east. If that would ever happen, and Jews would suffer immense persecution, you would sleep very well knowing that finally a Palestinian state was established.
12. You might be an anti-Semite if you think Palestinian refugees suffer just as much today, or even more, than Jews throughout history, and they suffer more currently than Israelis would if they were exiled ""back"" to Europe or the middle east - ignoring the unbelievable amount of anti-Semitism and persecution against Jews that existed for millennia and still does. You call both groups ""refugees"" as if their only problem in the world is ""anti-immigrant bigotry"".
13. You might be an anti-Semite if you think Jews ""gave up"" their human/national rights the moment they decided to live near or among Palestinians during the beginning of the Zionist movement, and they can never get those back. Several hundred thousand refugees displaced in 1948 disqualify all millions of Jews and their descendants until the end of time from ever being allowed to live in the region, even if they live in a city they built from the ground up themselves and was never inhabited by Arabs before.
14. You might be an anti-Semite if you think the land of Palestine used to be purely Arab, and therefore no Jew could ever be native to it, even if they're there for 2, 3, 7 generations, and have no other place they could be accepted in. Around 4/5 of Israeli Jews are born in Israel, Israel is the only country on earth that speaks their native language, they have no other place to be ""deported"" to. No other place on earth bears their culture and people. But that doesn't matter to you, because you think the 7th century Arab Muslim conquest was so successful it could never be overturned, and everyone who considers themselves Arab today (and DOESN'T consider themselves Jewish!) is automatically native to Palestine.
15. You might be an anti-Semite if you think Jews would be just as protected in Europe and America as they are in their own Jewish state today, and how dare they want to have control over their own government. You think Jews should be obedient and subservient to their rulers wherever they live, be they Christian or Muslim. But demanding a state controlled by and for Jews is ""racist"".
16. You might be an anti-Semite if you deny that Jews are an [ethnoreligious group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnoreligious_group). You act as if being Jewish is just the same as a hobby like liking NASCAR or Taylor Swift, and so it makes no sense in your mind that a group of Jews wanted to live in their own ancestral homeland and historic cultural center. If you would think about it a bit further, you'd reach a pretty perplexing conundrum when you contemplate why Jews were a persecuted group for millennia, or how Jews today share so many [genetic markers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_studies_on_Jews).
17. You might be an anti-Semite if you try to ignore the fact that Jews lived in the region continuously for millennia, because that doesn't comfortably fit your agenda.
18. You might be an anti-Semite if you don't want Jews to have the right of self determination. (Fun fact: That is the dictionary definition of Zionism. If all anti-Zionists actually used that label accurately, that is what they would all believe in)
19. You might be an anti-Semite if you think Ashkenazi Jews are ""just some random white people"" who claim to be Jews so they could... steal some tiny land that's mostly desert, and put themselves into one of the most volatile conflicts in recent history. The [Khazar myth](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Khazar_myth) has been debunked a million times over.
20. You might be an anti-Semite if you completely deny that Israeli culture exists, and insist that Israelis steal everything of their culture from the local Arabs, even if much of their culture, cuisine, songs etc has been in their communities for generations before they stepped in Israel, even if they have so many traditions and mores that aren't shared by any other people, including their very own language and distinct religion.
21. You might be an anti-Semite if you think Jews aren't even oppressed, and so don't deserve a state of their own at all. You believe Jews are ALL rich and powerful, so how could there be an entire anti-Semitic movement to oppress them? Don't let reality shatter your fragile imagination.
22. You might be an anti-Semite if you oppose Jews' and Israelis' definitions of terms like Zionism and anti-Semitism, and you want to force them to accept your own partisan definition. You feel insulted when they dare define the ideologies they subscribe to in a way you wouldn't approve of, especially if it makes your political cause to look morally suspicious. You don't want to side with the ""evil Zionists"", but you don't want people to think you deny the right to self determination to Jews and no other ethnic group - you want to convince your peers that Jews wanting self determination is somehow racist.
23. You might be an anti-Semite if you cite a handful of Jewish and Israeli speakers with a completely extreme fringe opinion, often discredited by the mainstream of Jews and Israelis and sometimes even condemned, and you insist that they speak on behalf of ALL Jews or Israelis, or that ""REAL"" Jews MUST agree with that fringe opinion, or else they are ""malicious Zionists"". You ignore the fact that the overwhelming majority of Jews describe themselves as Zionists and as pro-Israel, and they're absolutely not crazy for doing so. Still you claim that any deviation from the fringe opinion of your token Jews is either a lie or bigoted. You're sure the few Jews you know in organizations like JVP prove that all REAL Jews agree with your stance, and therefore by association they *probably* also agree with your significantly less popular beliefs, for example that Israel shouldn't exist.
24. You might be an anti-Semite if you favor politicians that tell Jews ""what they really are"" or ""what they should really think and do"". For example telling them that they're not an ethnic group, or insisting that they must be against the investigation of Labour anti-Semitism, or that they have to support complete secularization of the government, or that they should agree that ""anti-Semitism isn't as big a deal in society as some people portray it"". The fact that Jews avidly resist your suggestions doesn't bother you in the slightest, you don't think they should have a choice in the matter, they should just accept your ""truths"" regardless of their desires.
25. You might be an anti-Semite if you have Jewish friends, but only anti-Zionist ones. Having a Zionist friend would be an instant deal breaker, and would not fly. Meanwhile, you have lots of other friends from all sorts of ethnicities and religions and nationalities, and you would never be so bigoted to hate them because of their politics. If your Iranian friend supports the Iranian theocratic totalitarian regime, you just think they're patriotic or something and wouldn't question them further. You give them the benefit of the doubt.
26. You might be an anti-Semite if you think it's OK for the Women's March to forbid Zionists from participating, but you would never do the same vetting for supporters of China or Saudi Arabia or Russia, even if those countries commit atrocities on such a larger scale. In fact, Jews entering marches and protests, especially with suspicious banners and symbols such as the star of David, are eyed throughout the entire event, to make absolutely sure that they aren't - god forbid - Zionists or anything.
27. You might be an anti-Semite if you use the ""Arabs are Semites"" argument to try and remove the unpleasant label of anti-Semite from actual Jew haters. What other reason could you have to not want someone who you agree hates Jews and incites against Jews, to be labeled with the buzzword ""anti-Semite"", if not to protect anti-Semites?
28. You might be an anti-Semite if you think Palestinians have every right to do whatever they want with their land regardless of what Jews think, including setting their own immigration policies and religious institutions, even though you claim that is EXACTLY what was wrong with the establishment of Israel.
29. You might be an anti-Semite if you're willing to ignore or excuse terror and support terrorist groups that are explicitly anti-Semitic, because they're allied with your cause. You don't care what they intend to do with Jews if they ever have control in the region, that is none of your concern.
30. You might be an anti-Semite if you would excuse Palestinian [bigotry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_Palestinian_territories), anti-Semitism and support for literal terrorism because ""they were occupied, it's only a natural response"" to support violent attacks against a non-combatant civilian population. (This is a common definition for terror, mind you. And these acts are widely supported, or at least excused, by both Palestinians and pro-Palestinian activists). This is soft bigotry of low expectations, wrapped with casual disdain for the lives of Jewish people.
31. You might be an anti-Semite if you think it goes without saying that Arab locals in the 19th century would oppose Jewish immigration to the land... even if that land is somewhere completely uninhabited that Arabs never lived in and were never expelled from, even if the Jewish immigrants really tried to integrate in the society, even if the anti-Jewish sentiment was directed at inhabitants living in that region for many generations. You still think it's undeniably racist for Israelis today to be opposed to Palestinian immigration, even if that means just wanting to restrict the number of people allowed the ""right of return"", and not actively waging a war against the immigrants like Arab nations did in 1948.
32. You might be an anti-Semite if, when terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas say explicitly anti-Semitic things like calling for the death of all Jews, you try to obfuscate that and say that they ONLY mean Israelis, or specifically the Israeli government and its officials who support right-wing policies. You decry Zionists for implying that Hamas harbors any anti-Semitic sentiment - no-one knows better than you what constitutes a threat to the Jewish people or doesn't.
33. You might be an anti-Semite if you believe Jews claiming to worry about their own safety, is nothing but a deceitful ploy, and a codeword for annihilating all Palestinians. Jews have no security concerns, even if they were to die in the thousands, only Palestinians do.
34. You might be an anti-Semite if you think the UN is a balanced and useful organization when it condemns Israel a million times but never condemns North Korea or China or Russia or Saudi Arabia. You think UN resolutions are actually reflective of reality and of oppressive regimes in the world, even when its members include such regimes in high positions.
35. You might be an anti-Semite if you think criticizing the right of Jewish people to live in self determination in their own land is equivalent to ""just criticizing some Israeli policies"". You would never deny the right of ethnic Italians to live in Italy, and you would never compare it to ""just criticizing some of Sergio Mattarella's policies"", however the Jewish state is fair game.
36. You might be an anti-Semite if you conflate a call for Jewish self determination with the idea of ethnically cleansing all Palestinians, and claim ALL Zionists support that, or else they aren't ""really"" Zionists. That would be equivalent to saying Jews shouldn't have the rights to own property (rights they were sometimes denied in the past 2000 years in certain countries) because if Jews could own property, they would ""inevitably"" oppress the local population and hoard money and rape Christian or Muslim girls etc etc, in a bizarrely illogical slippery slope. Pretty classic anti-Semitism.
37. You might be an anti-Semite if you don't care that Palestinians used to be under Jordanian, Egyptian, British or Ottoman rule. They were completely fine under all of those, they thrived and had a prosperous society. But living under Jews in Israel is completely intolerable, and so the Jewish state must be eliminated, the sooner the better. You also ignore the horrible persecution Palestinians suffer from in nearby Arab countries like Lebanon, and insist that Israel commits the lion's share of harm towards the Palestinians, and therefore we should focus on them.
38. You might be an anti-Semite if you think Palestine was the name of a millennia-old region with people of all sorts of ethnicities and religions - but Jews can NEVER be considered Palestinian and NEVER be allowed control over ANY land, despite the fact that Jews (aka Judeans) used to constitute a major part of the ethnic population, and in fact maintained a continuous presence in the region.
39. You might be an anti-Semite if you imply that Jews could live in perfect harmony in a Palestinian state, with no reason to worry whatsoever, since Palestinians would never harm a fly. However, Palestinians would never accept living under Jewish rule, or even under a secular rule where Jews are guaranteed the law of return. This would cause a civil war, and the Palestinians would be 100% justified in resisting this regime that allows Jews to gain citizenship. Jews must never be allowed to live in a place of their own.
40. You might be an anti-Semite if you don’t think it's racist at all to be opposed to the ONLY Jewish state in the world, even though you think Israelis opposing the Palestinian state RIGHT NEXT TO THEM can ONLY do so because they are racist against Arabs/Muslims. You can't think of any other practical political reason Jews would be opposed to a Palestinian state.
41. You might be an anti-Semite if you cite events in Jewish history, like the Roman exile, or Jesus' times, or the Spanish Inquisition, or the battle of Khaybar, or the battle of Jericho - or especially the Holocaust - to judge Israel's actions today, mostly to claim they are ""hypocritical"" and ""should have learned that lesson from history"". I thought conflating Israel and the Jewish people was something Zionists do?
42. You might be an anti-Semite if you call Israeli Arabs who support and enjoy living in Israel ""normalizers"" and ""traitors"" and an ""obstacle to peace/progress"", not realizing that Arabs and Jews living together is literally the only way forward to peace and progress. You could find the same salty reaction when Israel and the UAE announced relations, and no doubt when other Arab countries will follow suit. Egypt and Jordan were berated a lot for making peace with Israel.
43. You might be an anti-Semite if you view all Jews, Israelis or Zionists in the same way, as if there is only one political party in Israel with 100% support, as if the Israeli people aren't an extraordinarily divided and heterogeneous society. Supporting Israel, serving in the IDF, calling yourself Zionist, in your mind it all means ""agreeing with literally everything the Israeli far-right says and wants"". You ignore the numerous amounts of diverse Israeli political parties that all have widely different opinions on matters. As the saying goes, ""two Jews, three opinions"", but you don't care about the opinion of ANY Jew.
44. You might be an anti-Semite if, when debating lobbying and your country's policies, you only care about JEWISH Zionist organizations like AIPAC and don't give a second thought to ones like CUFI, despite it being much more influential in US politics. You wouldn't immediately question a Christian politician's intentions in the middle east, but when there is a Jewish politician they are automatically scrutinized and endlessly questioned, to verify their entire stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If they dare support the existence of the Jewish state, every word that comes out of their mouth is to be completely disregarded.
45. You might be an anti-Semite if you claim that whenever someone says the tiniest bit of criticism toward Israel, they are ""immediately shouted down"" and ""silenced"", despite the fact that there is massive amounts of valid criticism that is NEVER ""silenced"" - notably from actual Jews and Israelis, who thankfully mostly know how to criticize specific Israeli policies without falling for or using anti-Semitic tropes. That's saying the least, they do much more than just criticize Israeli policies, Jews and Israelis (as well as other, actually sane and balanced non-anti-Semites) constantly criticize all sorts of things that Israel does, including IDF actions, immigration policies, discrimination towards minorities, you name it. They just do it in a way that doesn't delegitimize the existence of the Jewish state, or implies that IDF soldiers are ""literally indistinguishable from the actual Nazis"". When you're called out for saying these stupid assertions, it's mostly because people point out your lies and misinformation, rarely because you're actually bigoted, although that does happen when you say ACTUALLY bigoted opinions.
46. And finally, you might be an anti-Semite if you literally bring up anti-Semitic myths and shift them on Zionists. For example: ""Zionists love money, Zionists are genetically evil, Zionists have been wicked since time immemorial (even though Zionism only existed for a couple of centuries), Zionists control the world and the media and hypnotize everyone, Zionists hate Muslims and Christians and want to destroy them, Zionists try to control the world (from their <10M population country), Zionism is an unnatural and alien ideology, Zionists are using the Holocaust for pity, Zionists are hungry for as much land as they can possibly have, Zionists have no conscience and love killing children, Zionists are only loyal to their own people, Zionists enjoy spreading as much chaos throughout the world as possible, Zionists have no moral connection to all other humans in the world and don't care in the slightest about them,"" etc.

Of course I am not saying any of you on this sub believe in any of those statements, or that any of you are anti-Semitic. However, you should acknowledge that there are many people who do believe in some or even many of those statements, and many of them deny publicly that they are anti-Semitic. Maybe they don't even realize how anti-Semitic those tropes are. Many people in the pro-Palestinian community fail to realize the deep connection their movement has to anti-Semitism, and give their full support to it as it furthers anti-Semitic talking points, even as its expressed goals would spell a disastrous existence for Jews were they reality. Jews are human beings who deserve rights, they don't deserve being [delegitimized, demonized and subjected to double standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Ds_of_antisemitism).

If you find that you agree with one or more of the statements above, I highly suggest you reconsider your stance and see if you might harbor anti-Semitic sentiments or fall for anti-Semitic tropes and tactics. In any case, I said ""you might be"" at the beginning of each statement because I meant just that - you MIGHT be anti-Semitic. You're not necessarily automatically evil if you believe in any of those things, there's just a high suspicion that you might be. The only one who can know for sure is YOU, which is why I'm directing this at you. Take this not as an aggressive barrage of accusations, but as an opportunity for introspection. I will have no hard feelings to you if you believe any of the above statements... well, it would be easier if you say you now renounce those.",18/08/20 13:51:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/ic1d44/you_might_be_an_antisemite_if/,280,266,4061,Israel,top,all
1b774on,The Arab world had 2 choices on October 8th. It chose the wrong one.,"On October 7th Hamas launched an unprovoked medieval era raid on southern Israel that resulted in the death of 1200 people -mostly civilians- and during the attack Hamas has used torture and sexual violence against its victims. The result was an apocalyptic scene. Innocent children, women, elderly and men including holocaust survivors, taken as war booty back to Gaza.

The Arab world endorsed and celebrated the attack within its territories and beyond in western capitals. Al-Azhar -one of the most prestigious Islamic institutions in the world and one seen as a force for peace and tolerance- [endorsed Hamas](https://www.copticsolidarity.org/2023/11/14/sheikh-al-azhar-lauds-killing-civilians/) and issued a fatwa basically saying that no Israeli Jew can be seen as a civilian.

The countries and institutions that did not endorse the attack, did not distance themselves from it. Instead they waited for days until they could finally issue vague statements condemning mostly Israel and calling for peace, while getting away with not endorsing this medieval butchery celebrated in their streets.

There were 2 choices that the Arab world could have made. It could have been responsible and attempted to contain anything that could have been contained by clearly denouncing the massacre and distancing themselves therefore not reinforcing the idea that Israelis are surrounded by people that want to genocide them, or....this.

It didn't make the former choice.

The reason why until this day the ""Zionists"" are demanding denouncing Hamas' massacre is the simple fact that it's seen as a heroic battle by tens if not hundreds of millions of people in the middle east and worldwide. This is a problem that you cannot just ignore, and proceed to listening to those people demanding this or that regarding Gaza. And needless to say, this problem precedes this ongoing war between Hamas and Israel.",05/03/24 14:55:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1b774on/the_arab_world_had_2_choices_on_october_8th_it/,280,672,294,Israel,top,all

1bncl2a,Yet another fake rape claims by Palestinians - This time it backfired so they admit it was faked,"As many of you probably know, ever since the UN started investigating and eventually found clear and credible reports about sexual violence by Hamas in October 7, as reported for example by [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-finds-evidence-of-rape-on-oct-7-and-after-israel-they-tried-to-downplay-issue/), [abc news](https://abcnews.go.com/International/finds-clear-evidence-israeli-hostages-experienced-sexual-violence/story?id=107787501), and even anti-Israeli orgs [like the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68474899), the ""Pro-Palestinian"" side felt the pressure to blame Israel of the things they are guilty of.

As such, a fake investigation was started, spearheaded by antisemitic actors such as Reem Asalem and Francesca Albanese. I will not go into detail about that since user /u/allthenopeandmore did a [fantastic job lately](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bm8r3o/claims_of_idf_sexual_assaults/) at exposing the hilarious hypocrisy, lack of any evidence and lies of it all.

Well now, as their earlier attempt of a modern day blood libel failed, Al Jazeera tried another go at it, using a lying testimony from the current Shifa operation. Which apparently hinged about a fake testimony of a Palestinian woman.

And from there the lie went to Al Terrorists Jazeera, from there to social media, where many additional fake reports embellished in more stories and details. All complete lies.

#But the effect took unprecedented turn

Instead of just more unjustified hate to Israel, it also caused Palestinians who believed their own people's lies to flee the north and middle of the strip south, something very bad for Hamas who can't let go of their human shields, so suddenly a day later those lies are being retracted.

**[This sort of thing has been happening for 75 years now](https://youtu.be/72Ata-hY9WQ?si=mg36lj2q-GEkTdgA)**. The Palestinians make up lies so the world will attack ""The Evil Zionists"" and while it works, it also does damage to themselves in plenty of ways.

Well now, Al Jazeera removed all records of the accusation that IDF soldiers committed acts of rape.

Here is what former Al Jazeera managing director [wrote on X](https://twitter.com/abuhilalah/status/1771996521312973088):

*It was revealed through Hamas investigations that the story of the rape of women in #مستشفى_الشفاء was fabricated. Of course, the enemy did not hesitate to commit the crime of genocide.*

*The woman who spoke about rape justified her exaggeration and incorrect talk by saying that the goal was to arouse the nation’s fervor and brotherhood! As if more than thirty thousand martyrs, ninety thousand wounded, about a million displaced people, and comprehensive destruction were not enough!""*

From an [article](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-793560) from Jpost about the whole thing:

>Although the Qatari mouthpiece has yet to officially refer to the retraction, all content related to the allegation has been deleted.

...

>After more than 24 hours of letting the story run freely, Qatari mouthpiece Al Jazeera deleted the page featuring their former story, which accused Israeli soldiers of allegedly perpetrating rape against women during the IDF’s latest excursion against Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who barricaded themselves inside the former hospital-cum-terror headquarters at Shifa Hospital.

What is seen here is a classic example of how Palestinian propaganda works.

Make up a lie, run with it and spread it around the world using billions of antisemites in social media. Then admit it was a lie quietly.

17isqok,Why are there so many innocent civilian casualties in Gaza?,"You probably heard many times that Hamas uses its own civilians as human shields.

But, what does this actually mean?

I’ll try to break it down. it's a little long but worth the read :)

First a little bit of background and data.

* Gaza has 2.1M people living in a strip that is considered one of the most populated areas in the world. Top 5 as far as density.
* Israel evacuated all of its citizens from the Gaza strip in 2005 passing the keys and sovereignty to the PLO without any blockades or restrictions.
* Gaza had free elections in 2007, backed and monitored by the G.W Bush’s administration.Hamas won those elections and immediately eliminated all competing political parties. the most famous of them was the killing of more than 400 PLO members, in a brutal manner. (Throwing them out of the windows of tall residential buildings)
* Since 2007 Hamas fully controls the Gaza strip killing any dissidents and political adversaries that might pose a risk to their power.
* Hamas hasn’t held another election in Gaza till this day.

**So what does human shield actually mean?**

1. Hamas is **embedded** **and operates from civilian infrastructure** using **hospitals, mosques, schools,** [UN centers](https://x.com/IDF/status/1716156227585974585?s=20)**,** news broadcasts buildings and **innocent civilian homes**.How do they do it?
   1. Hamas has a huge underground city of tunnels, famously known as the “Gaza metro”. These **tunnels are located right under these strategic civil areas** to make them less visible and [harder to attack without the complete distruction of these places](https://x.com/IDF/status/1717924811903562126?s=20). These civilian infrastructure are oftenly used as warehouses and semi-military bases -storing rockets and weaponry.
   2. Hamas operates from, and near, these infrastructures launching thousands of rockets at Israel. Statistics show that about **10% of the rockets**[fall short](https://x.com/IDF/status/1714548529538953637?s=20) and land in Gaza, [killing their own civilians](https://x.com/IDF/status/1714513625598021868?s=20). (Most times you would never hear about these cases, as it is not reported by Israel nor by Hamas, for obvious reasons, but they contribute to many civilian deaths.)
   3. This method of embedding themselves between civilian populations is a cynical move that works for Hamas. Why? For 2 main reasons.
      1. Hamas knows that the IDF will be reluctant to retaliate and strike civilian populated areas. So **if the IDF doesn’t attack it allows them to keep attacking Israel,** **untouched**.
      2. If the IDF does decide to strike, it might result in a **high number of civilian casualties which might bring international outrage towards Israel**.The high numbers of innocent palestinian deaths serves Hamas in their propaganda. It **increases sympathy towards the Palestinians and leads to millions of dollars in donations** given to them by the international community, which keeps their military operation running. Needless to say it portrays the palestinian as oppressed people being killed by a ruthless oppressor.
2. **Many reports show that Hamas prevents its own civilians from taking shelters and even encourages them to stay in their place** under false pretenses that Israel won't attack.This has been widely reported and comes in many forms.
   1. The IDF has a **procedure called “knock on the roof”** which is basically dropping a small and unharmful bomb (that is well noticeable) on the roof of a building before it plans to fully attack it. **It gives civilians a 10 minute warning to evacuate the building, giving them a chance to escape and evacuate to safe zones**. This procedure is a measure IDF takes in order to comply with international law and minimize civilian deaths.
   2. In cases,when the IDF wants to strike high-rise buildings consisting of many residents, **military officers even call the residents urging them to leave.**
   3. **\*\*If you are wondering, it's not by chance that there is footage of every building bombardment in Gaza. It's precisely because they have a heads up that a strike is on its way.\*\*4**.
   4. This “knock on the roof” procedure doesn’t apply if the target is Hamas militants or high ranked Hamas officials. It does happen 100% of the times when Israel bombs Hamas infrastructures.
   5. **Hamas** media channels and armed militants **encourage civilians not to leave their homes** once they get the “knock on the roof” warning. Obviously most of them do leave, but some, for unknown reasons, do decide to stay.
   6. In this current war (2023), IDF issued and implored Gaza civilians in the northern part of Gaza to head south and take cover for their own safety. It did so by scattering thousands of leaflets calling civilians to temporarily evacuate to the south and pointing out which escape routes they should take. Hamas physically prevented them from doing so, by creating checkpoints, and [roadblocks](https://x.com/CIJAinfo/status/1713322644706103618?s=20) in the corridor. **In one case reported, they even planted a remote bomb on one civilian truck going south which resulted in about 70 civilian deaths.**
   7. There are also various other recorded calls of [Gazan civilians which complain that Hamas is preventing them from leaving](https://x.com/IDF/status/1717473359003291900?s=20) to the south part of the strip.

Worth mentioning that **Hamas militants do take cover in the underground tunnels while risking their civilians and urging them to stay in their homes above the ground.**

They do not provide underground tunnels (shelters) for civilian purposes thus not giving them the same conditions they have for themselves. If it’s not absurd enough, **Hamas’s leadership and their families are comfortably safe in the finest Hotels Qatar has to offer.**

**Unfortunately the number of palestinian casualties is high** and will probably keep on rising due to the mentioned above. Hopefully you can get a better understanding of the root causes and why this happens.

**Israel** goes to extreme measures to avoid and minimize civilian casualties. It **has everything to lose from creating a high amount of civilian deaths and has no interest in causing such destruction.**

On the contrary, **Hamas has every interest to use its civilians and inflate the number of civilian casualties**, as it maintains their legitimacy, recognition and control over the Gaza strip.It basically gets its power by following this vicious cycle:

High amount of **civilian casualties** →  increasing **sympathy from the International community** → Delegitimizing Israel and portraying it as an oppressor → **Funds and donations entering Gaza** →  **Hamas remains in power** and in control of the Gaza strip.",29/10/23 01:57:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17isqok/why_are_there_so_many_innocent_civilian/,274,638,1037,Israel,top,all

Everyone refuses to answer when you ask them what the process should look like because they know.I've yet to see anyone acknowledge even a single of Palestine's war crimes, instead always deflecting to ""but what about Israel!"" though they never bring up any actual examples, just things that are plainly wrong. When you're firing rockets from a school, that school becomes a military target. These people would lose to a group of like 100 terrorists if they got to rule a country lmao, all the terrorists would have to do is hide in a city and write ""school"" on where they attack from, and use civilians as shields.

They think everything is a genocide while never bothering to look up the definition. They pretend like it's just a few bad apples when Hamas has support from the population. They call Israel an apartheid state while also having no clue what it means. They demand to see footage of dead babies and raped women, even though it shouldn't need to get proven that an organisation that calls for the death of all Jews is absolutely barbaric.

As a Jew I'm honestly scared of these people. There's 1000s in my city waving Palestinian flags with banners saying ""ALL of Palestine will be free through Jihad."" What is going on?? I feel like I'm going crazy, can someone just explain? Am I somehow misunderstanding their arguments??

“Joshua, the oldest of five children, had finished a diploma in agriculture studies in Morogoro, and had arrived in Israel in September, the first time he had left his home country. 

On the day of the October 7 attack, he and two of the other Tanzanian students on the exchange programme, Ezekiel Kitiku and Clemence Mtenga, scrambled to get to their closest shelters after hearing sirens warning about the attack. 

As they were working different shift patterns and at different farms, they were not together, and had to communicate using WhatsApp, which seemingly cut off at around 10am. 

Ezekiel told the BBC that after this, he did not hear any news about the others until he found out that Clemence, originally taken hostage, was declared dead on November 18, and had his body sent back to Tanzania.”

197mc0c,Telling Israelis to go “home” to Europe is one of the stupidest things ever..,"I’m absolutely against the happenings in Gaza (I’m not trying to play it down, just scrolling through the posts I noticed that the reporting bot is very stict), and I’m all for freedom, but telling Jewish people to leave the land and go home to Europe where they came from is so dumb and ignorant imo.

1) Jewish people have been living in this land for millenia (sources vary, but up to ~1500BC), and not everyone is todays Israel is from “foreign” ancestry. 
2) the very definition of being Jewish is that the given person ties his ancestry to the ancient Jewish people (descendant of Jewish people), so regardless wether a persons ancestors have been living in Europe since 500 AD, they are Jewish bc their ties to the land. This is their homeland (obv the rightseusness of existence of the modern state of Israel is up for debate, but wether Jews are allowed to live there is not a question.) telling them to go back to Europe where their ancestrs were expelled to by the romans and other conquerers is pretty senseless, concidering what happened to them in Europe in the 20th century.
3) The residents of todays Israel are born and raised there mostly, their grandparents/great grand parents came from Europe and other Jewish diasporas (africa, syria etc), and their closest ancestors have been living there for 70+ years. I’m from Hungary (not jewish btw, jusr a regular Hungarian person), but looking at my family tree, I have ancestors from Croatia, Germany, Netherlands etc, I would be quite upset if Anyone told me to “go back to Croatia where you came from”.

Yesterday we went to a rally marking this cursed day, in the biggest hospital in Tel Aviv, there is a huge timer counting every second since the 7.10, when they were kidnapped. It was raining, everybody cried when it hit 100 on 00:00.
 Today, after a test we had at school, the school decided to stop the school day for this day. My entire grade went to the speech room, and they bought the women that's in charge of the hostage and hostage family organisation. She spoke about how much work they have to do, providing thousands of people psychological care, some are cousins or classmates of hostages, some are parents. She said how she thinks she will never feel happy again after what she has seen, described all the political things the organisation has to do for things that beraly matter. Just now, after a hundred cursed days, they were able to talk hamas and the red cross into getting to the hostages to provide medication. Not even medical care. Medication. She described how there are doctors in the organisation, who every day carefully calculate what's the medical status of every hostage, some have heart disease, some asthma, some are old, some have allergies and some are just dying of hunger. After her speech was over we went as a class to the ""hostage square"", a place in front of the Tel Aviv museum that since 7.10, has been used as a place for people who know hostages to get psychological care, make art, and cry together. When we got there, one guy went up on stage, he was mumbling and on the verge of tears, he said that he is the father of one of the kidnapped teenage boys. He said how he have been going to every military funeral, hugging the parents knowing they're child died trying to find and bring home his boy. He said how much he loves the people of Israel, how much love and support we have as a nation. Me and everybody else couldn't stop crying in the pouring rain. After him a doctor went on stage. Describing the poor medical status of our boys and girls. Calling for the red cross and world medical organisation to step in and stop this madness. After she stepped of stage I started crying too hard, I couldn't stay there anymore and cried historically all the way home. 100 days. Every second you read this there are 136 innocent civilians being held by hamas.

17oryd2,How to commit a “genocide” in Gaza according to some in the media.,"1-give the people 3 weeks to evacuate and send them maps of escape routes. 

2-drop thousands of leaflets and warn the population before an area will be bombed.

3-focus on military targets which are intentionally placed near civilian areas to maximize casualties.

4-eventually allow humanitarian aid to enter the area you’re attacking (a bit too late imo).

5-kill 9000+ people in state with a population of millions despite having one of the most advanced militaries in the world. 

6-allow the population to continue accessing the internet despite the fact that it is advantageous for your enemy. 

Just to be clear, I think all civilian deaths on both sides are tragic but the narrative of a genocide being committed by Israel is just wrong. This is a military conflict against a brutal terrorist regime which tragically led to many deaths.

174vn95,It seems that only one side of this conflict has truly matured morally.,"When I look at Hamas fighting, I see them taking innocent Palestinians and deliberately getting them killed as propaganda, I see them torturing Israeli children, taking their phones and uploading to that child's social media, I see them raping, sodomizing, mutilating, and murdering innocents.

&#x200B;

When I look at Israel fighting, I see them forewarning people in buildings so they can find safety in time. I see them standing up for their own citizens and putting themselves through death to protect them. I see them supplying electricity and water to land they don't even want to control.

&#x200B;

How can we expect Hamas, which was voted in by Palestinians to govern more land considering the above? They proudly celebrate deaths of innocents. It is undeniable that Israel's standards of morality have grown immensely since Nakba. I feel there's no excuse for Israel to give any more territory. Palestine has had their chance and have blown it by committing barbaric atrocities. What do you guys think?

18trden,The Pro-Palestine movement isn't interested in a two-state solution; Removing Israel is the goal,"The more I read from pro-palestine and free palestine sources, both online and in print and in books, it seems clear that a 2-state solution is not what they have ever wanted.

Here's why:

The Nakba is the most important event in Palestinian history. Over 700,000 people were displaced during a war resulting from Arab armies invading Israel. The entire objective of the Free Palestine movement is essentially to turn back time to 1948 and get a do-over.

A two-state solution is sadly not a solution Palestinians want or deem acceptable. It's why every single Free Palestine necklace, poster, imagery showcases a map that includes the entire land of Israel. The entire land is Palestine in their eyes.

The idea of a Palestinian country sitting just on Gaza and the West Bank (with a shared Jerusalem) is insufficient, which is why they are holding strong to the idea of a full right of return for all refugees and their descendants. The demand, however, is impractical and detrimental to their cause as it's a non-starter for Israel.

It's curious and bizarre that no other refugee group in history, besides the Palestinians, includes descendants of actual refugees. Despite this, Israel in peace offers in the past has offered to take in 100,000 refugees who actually lived in what is now Israel, while also helping establish a $30 BILLION fund to help descendents resettle in a newly formed Palestinian state and elsewhere.

This offer was rejected.

The offer wasn't good enough because the real issue is the existence of Israel itself, which Palestinians believe was created on stolen land. Never mind the fact that none of this would have happened had Arab armies not invaded, the fact remains that the Palestinian cause is so rooted in the removal of Israel as a Jewish entity that a two-state solution isn't something Palestinians view as an acceptable solution.

The Palestinian vision for peace involves the removal of Israel as a country and a new country in its place with a majority Palestinian population. It's why Free Palestine folks are now advocating for a single state solution, which is a nice way of saying that Israel will evaporate to make way for Palestine. It's essentially saying --  Israel has created a thriving democracy for 75 years, lets just piggyback off that and make it our own instead of building our own country.

The Palestinians feel that they are owed all of the land, and are constantly told that if they continue to insist on this, they will get it. This is why, in the United States, people who have never lived in or around Israel continue to talk about how the state was stolen from them. In contrast, every other group of refugees in history (especially those who suffered as a result of losing a war) have moved on and accepted the reality of their current situation.

I used to believe a two-state solution was possible, but after seeing what the vast majority of Pro-Palestine publications and pundits are putting forth, it seems that the idea of Israel in its current form -- without the return of millions of Palestinans -- is a dealbreaker. Which is tragic because if true, the Palestinians would rather cling to the notion of the right of return in perpetutity rather than start country-building.

There will never be peace until a Palestinian leader emerges who can blankly state that Israel is a reality and that a 2-state solution is the only path towards peace.",29/12/23 16:44:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18trden/the_propalestine_movement_isnt_interested_in_a/,262,648,583,Israel,top,all
174rc7o,About the war going on right now.,"Hello,  
I'll start off by saying that I am a 29 years old Israeli who, like most able bodied adult in Israel has served in the IDF (I wasn't really a ""fighter"" per se, I served in a Search and rescue unit that's main purpose was to rescue trapped civilians in collapsed buildings after missile strikes or deal with ABC warfare (atomic, biological and chemical)).

  
After reading through posts and comments on the matter of the war I would like to say but one thing and that is I urge anyone who actually thinks he understand what Hamas is, to download the app ""Telegram"" and search the word ""Hamas"" in it, you'll quickly find yourself in a group of Hamas soldiers and see posts that were uploaded from the very terrorists who attacked Israel on Saturday morning and I assure you, after you see a group of terrorists kill people without batting an eye, raping women one after the other just to kill them when their done, you will understand what they are.  
If you think for a second that the IDF or any Israeli for that matter is capable of such atrocities, the people who were slaughtered by the millions not a 100 years ago and still have living proofs from that time, I promise you, we are not.  
My heart goes out to the civilians of Gaza who are tormented by Hamas, I wish I could save you all, and hopefully the government of Israel will act in a way that'll allow you to live freely, because no decent human being can support such crimes against a fellow man.  


And for anyone wondering, yes, without terrorists group like Hamas and Hezbollah, there would be freedom and peace in the Middle East, for everyone.",10/10/23 17:48:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/174rc7o/about_the_war_going_on_right_now/,264,190,295,Israel,top,all
1b0r9vv,"No, Winning a War Isn't ""Genocide""","In the months since the October 7th Hamas attacks, Israel’s military actions in the ensuing war have been increasingly denounced as “genocide.” This article challenges that characterization, delving into the definition and history of the concept of genocide, as well as opinion polling, the latest stats and figures, the facts and dynamics of the Israel-Hamas war, comparisons to other conflicts, and geopolitical analysis. 

One of the most striking aspects of the politics surrounding this issue is encapsulated in this quote:“‘Genocide’ was coined during the Holocaust as a way to distinguish crimes of such unimaginable magnitude from other kinds of atrocities. The sad irony is that while two-thirds of young adults think Israel is guilty of genocide, a December, 2023 poll found that 20 percent of this same cohort thinks the Holocaust is a myth, and 30 percent aren’t sure. That’s right, most young people believe Israel is committing genocide, and half also agree or ‘neither agree nor disagree’ that the event which inspired the creation of the term — and perhaps the most clear-cut example of genocide in all of human history — is a myth. The double standard imposed on Jews may never be more neatly expressed in numbers.”

Also: “To put things in context, in World War II, allied bombing in populated areas ahead of the Battle of Normandy killed about 20,000 French civilians. More recently, as Posen notes, the 2016–2017 US-led campaigns to destroy the Islamic State in Mosul, Iraq and Raqqa, Syria — two cities that had a combined estimated population of 1.8 million — killed between 13,100 and 15,100 civilians. Gaza, by contrast, has an approximate population of 2.2 million.”

18aoeov,Hamas's sex crimes,"So, it took two months but Hamas's sex crimes during October 7 is starting to get more and more coverage around the world media, along with testimonies of survivors, footage and investigations.

I really want to hear the pro-palestine people about this, especially ones who denied the whole think and asked for proof and footage, especially from women who denied.

What are your thoughts on this manner? Do you still not believe? Do you believe now? Has your view about the conflict has been changed?

I hope we could have a real discussion and debate on this :)

17p8txf,"The ""Genocide"" claim is absurd","Pro-Palestinians are calming that Israel is committing a ""genocide"" without looking at the whole picture. I suggest you read everything I say before commenting.

1)Like it or not but Israel is hitting Hamas targets. The problem is that Hamas uses the population in Gaza to its advantage. first of all they put their military facilities inside Civilian building not only to make them harder for Israel to detect but also to make it easy to blame Israel for attacking civilians. With that reality Israel has an hard choice between attacking Hamas targets knowing that civilians could die or doing nothing and letting Hamas get away. And after Hamas did Israel cannot just let them get away with that it would be absurd.

here is a video that explains how Hamas uses one of the Hospital in Gaza:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4xVqsb2v9w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4xVqsb2v9w) and before just saying that it is Zionist propaganda I suggest you watch it and listen carefully to the points presented.

2)If Israel is so ""Genocidal"" why would they try so hard to evacuate civilians from Gaza? They could have just go in long ago and attack everything but Israel has chosen to give civilians time to escape the warzone. before they got into Gaza they opened a few times a corridor for people to escape to the southern part of Gaza and even now when they have encircled Gaza they have opened a corridor for people to escape Gaza city. The IDF has even dropped fliers from the air calling for civilians to go south and explaining how to do so.  And who didn't want them to escape? Hamas because they need them inside the city.

3) The numbers coming out of Gaza are missing one very important metric! First of all its is important to say that Hamas is the government of Gaza and as such they control the health ministry of Gaza so they control all of the information coming out of there. And there are no numbers of how many Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants have been killed in Gaza and it is likely that they count dead Hamas militants as civilians too. (There are around 30,000 Hamas militants and a few thousands more Islamic Jihad militants). and they could be counting militants under 18 years old in the dead children count. Now don't get me wrong civilians have died and will die because of the realities of urban warfare and because of Hamas's tactics and it is very unfortunate but we need to bare in mind that the information coming out of Gaza is probably unreliable.

4) A few days ago Hamas held a screening in the yard of one of the hospitals where they showed more than 1,000 people the atrocities they committed on the 7th of October. This shows that Israel's claims that Hamas has been stealing fuel to use for their prepuces is right. Because how come they claim that hospitals in Gaza are running out of fuel  but they have fuel to run this screenings? Also if Israel just wanted to kill civilians this could have been a great time to do so.

There are a lot more points I can present but it would be a very long post. I just ask of you to think a bit about the situation, about the reality of fighting a guerrilla group like Hamas and about the fact that Israel has to deal with them because Hamas's goal is to kill Israelis and Israel has to protect his people.

How sick is that mob of people? Literally entering an airport and asking everyone for their passports. If they are israeli, they would lynch them and maybe even kill them.
Jewish students STUCK inside a university library for HOURS because a free palestine mob were blocking the door and wanting to lynch them. SICK PEOPLE.

Good job on France & Germany to ban it. Most people in these rallys are SICK. They are not protesting for peace or free palestine, rather they just want to see their opponents BURN.

Btw we only try to aim for Hamas pepole, it’s sad seeing them put their own people/children in site of danger with rockets in their homes/buildings or in a children park

17ylc6q,Time to face the facts. Israel is not going anywhere.,"Frankly this has been bothering me quite a bit. Since October 7th, there is a new chorus of people (most of whom barely know 5% of the history of this region), who are joining in with “River to the sea” type energy. 

When someone says “Israel shouldn’t exist”, or “Israelis should go back to where they came from” - let’s be clear. Jews are from here. That is a stone cold fact.

Anyone bearing this philosophy is thinking way too simply about a conflict that is not simple. There are currently 4th & 5th generation Sabra Jews (for those that don’t know, meaning Jews born in Israel). Where are these people supposed to “go back to”? 

So if you are saying that I should go back to where I “came from” - I am not going “back” to Baghdad, where my grandparents were expelled from over half a century ago. I am staying put where I am, where I was born and raised. 

If your solution to the conflict is anything other than 1SS or 2SS, you are de facto asking for perpetual war, because you’re not willing to live next to me peacefully, you don’t acknowledge my right to be here, and I’m not going anywhere. If it’s perpetual war you want, that’s exactly what you will get, and you’ll keep coming out the loser. 

We must accept that in this conflict, Israelis (mostly) view 1948 as the liberation of our homeland. Palestinians (mostly) view it as a foreign colonizer. The thing is, decolonization generations after the fact is a war crime.

To add to Golda’s famous quotes, and TLDR: Only once we can all accept the CURRENT reality, and not view this conflict as if it were still 1948, that’s when we will make actual progress.",19/11/23 01:12:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17ylc6q/time_to_face_the_facts_israel_is_not_going/,255,855,298,Israel,top,all
nm40u4,People are accusing Israel of genocide,"  

Human rights lawyers who have been deeply critical of Israeli policy and actions say the term does not apply, calling the accusation ‘ridiculous’

Accusations that Israel has been committing genocide in Gaza have flown freely, from seasoned activists to the Palestinian foreign minister to people wading into the Israeli-Palestinian issue for the first time on social media. Tweets with the words “Israel” and “genocide” appeared as often as thousands of times per hour on Twitter during the 11-day conflict, in which more than 250 Palestinians and a dozen Israelis were killed.

But even human rights lawyers who have been deeply critical of Israeli policy and actions in Gaza and the West Bank say the genocide term doesn’t apply.

“First and foremost, in order to commit the crime of genocide, one needs to have an intention to exterminate, in whole or in part, a group,” Sfard said. “And in the 30 years of my activism and more than 20 years of litigation, I haven’t seen a shred of evidence that Israeli officials and decision-makers hold such an intention.”",27/05/21 09:59:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nm40u4/people_are_accusing_israel_of_genocide/,254,394,177,Israel,top,all

ndtk8l,16 Questions to Consider When Protesting Israel,"(reposting this from a friend on FB. Thoughts? I feel like this addresses a lot of points on Israel's intractable position)

As demonstrations against Israel take place around the world, I am asking those in my Facebook world who might be attending one to please consider the following questions in advance:

When demonstrators chant “Free Palestine from the River to the Sea”, meaning from the Mediterranean to the Jordan, do you realize they are calling for the ethnic cleansing of 6.5 million Jews from their indigenous ancestral homeland?  Is so, where do you suggest these Jews go, who will take them and how do you plan to guarantee their safety?  My elderly in-laws were born and raised in Israel.  What should they do?  What will keep them from the fate of the Kurds?

If Jews are not indigenous to Israel, where are they indigenous to?  From where did they come?  And why does Israel host so many Jewish religious artifacts and archaeological sites featuring Hebrew inscriptions?  Were those planted underground as some sort of grand ruse?  Would you consider an Irish person choosing to reside in Ireland as a form of colonialism?

If Israel’s citizens are guilty of genocide, as the demonstrators regularly declare, why are they so bad at it?  After all, the population growth in Gaza and the West Bank far outstrips that of Israel proper.  And why is Israel giving advance warning to Gaza’s inhabitants so they can flee before Israel fires upon Hamas installations, such as the media tower today?  Is Israel that inept at genocide?  And if not, how do you think it feels for a people who actually suffered genocide to have the accusation so lazily slapped upon them?

Have the protesters around you shown equal concern for the genocide of Uighurs in China or the Rohingya in Myanmar?  Have they recently protested at either country’s embassy?  If not, why is the situation in Israel so unique for them?  What makes the Jewish State so particularly villainous in their eyes?

When people such as Bernie Sanders say “Palestinian Lives Matter”, do you honestly believe that Israelis feel otherwise?  I don’t know any Jews or Israelis who are not distraught over the death of civilians in Gaza, and wish desperately that a peaceful resolution could be found that would allow all of Israel’s inhabitants to live safely and securely in the land.  Do you really conceive of Israel as an entire country of genocidal maniacs?

What will you say (not if but) when the protesters’ chants mutate from Anti-Zionism to Anti-Semitism with calls to harm Jews wherever they may be found?  Late last week, one such demonstrator bloodied a Jewish man with a metal chair.  Does this sit well with you?  Does your protest include Anti-Semitic images of Jews as vermin or blood thirsty animals?  Accusations of Jews controlling the world’s media and finance?  Libels of Jews as demonic or parasitic?  Do you realize this is why all synagogue preschools need to hire full time security guards?

If Israel is truly an apartheid state, how is there such diverse representation of various communities within private industry and government office?  In America, can you openly advocate for the country’s destruction and yet serve in congress?  You can in Israel!  How did Israeli Arabs come to make up 9% of Israel’s Knesset members?  And how did Arab Israeli George Karra get a seat on Israel’s Supreme Court?  Why do the majority of Israeli Arabs regularly poll that they would rather remain citizens of Israel than one of her neighboring states or even a newly formed Palestinian state?

Did you know that the majority of Israeli Jews are from the Middle East or North Africa?  Or did you assume they all present as white?  And if Palestine is truly “freed” from the Jews, will you tell the hundreds of thousands of Jews who fled to Israel when they were expelled from Arab countries to “go back to Europe”?

If you are upset about the wide discrepancy of civilian casualties between Israelis and Palestinians, would you feel better if more Israelis were killed?  Should Israel be blamed for building bomb shelters and Iron Dome missile defense systems while Hamas shoots rockets from schools and hospitals?  Would more dead Jews satisfy your rage?  

If Hamas has so little money for infrastructure and services for its citizens, how do they afford 2,000+ rockets, tunnels, drones, etc?  Where did those come from?  Did they suddenly win the lottery?

Do you think that if Israel returned to its 1967 borders and offered a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, that all would be forgiven?  If so, why was an offer of nearly this magnitude turned down without even a counteroffer?  Why does Hamas’ charter distinctly call for the destruction of Israel and attacks upon Jews?  And why did the Arab states seek to wipe Israel off the map both in 1948 and 1967 when not a single settlement existed?

Did you know that Gaza shares a border with Egypt, which could be opened at any time?  Have you protested against Egypt for not doing so?  Jordan occupied the West Bank between 1948 and 1967. Why was a Palestinian State not declared during this time?  Why is Israel uniquely to blame for the Palestinians’ awful predicament?     

Did you know that Israel allows for a free press while all pictures and stories out of Gaza must be approved by Hamas?  Did you ever wonder why there aren’t more pictures of Hamas terrorists in action?  And if an Israeli soldier shoots a Palestinian teenager who lunges at her with a knife, is she guilty of killing a child?

If Israel is a warmonger for attacking Hamas missile positions, what would be the more appropriate response as its citizens are fired upon?  Sit tight and wait until the attacks end?  Offer thoughts and prayers?  What would the US do if Mexico launched 2,000 rockets from Tijuana into San Diego?  
 
If your protest is co-organized by Jewish Voice for Peace, do you actually know any Jews who affiliate with this group?  Do you realize that they serve as a cover for Anti-Zionist rhetoric and openly advocate for the destruction of the State of Israel?  Do you also think that the Westboro Baptist Church speaks for all Christians?  Because I would bet that the ratio is pretty similar.

And perhaps most importantly - where are you and your fellow protesters receiving your information?  Do you think Twitter, TikTok and Instagram offer the depth of analysis that such a complex situation requires?  Can the conflict really be summarized in a tidy meme?  Have you spoken with anyone who has spent considerable time in Israel, the West Bank or Gaza?  Does your favorite celebrity or influencer research Middle Eastern history in their free time?  Would you take a Middle Eastern Studies class taught by Dua Lipa?

I fully understand your sense of empathy for the plight of civilians under fire and the awful images of maimed children and dead civilians.  And I understand your desire to point towards a culprit and define a terrible situation in terms of good and evil.  And I similarly understand the propensity to equate powerlessness with nobility and power with corruption.  But I ask you to consider these questions and decide for yourself if these protests truly share your values.

Thank you so much for considering.",16/05/21 17:42:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/ndtk8l/16_questions_to_consider_when_protesting_israel/,249,206,1229,Israel,top,all
17a79ip,IDF says assessment shows failed Islamic Jihad rocket launch caused Gaza hospital blast,"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-assessment-shows-failed-islamic-jihad-rocket-launch-caused-gaza-hospital-blast/

""The Israel Defense Forces says that based on “intelligence information,” a failed Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket caused the deadly blast at the Gaza hospital.

In a statement, the IDF says that “an analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit.”

“Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza,” the IDF adds.""

Note that Islamic Jihad is a different group from Hamas

174k4vq,Hamas has killed more civilians in two days than Israel has in nearly a decade.,"I'm writing this to help put the conflict into perspective for those who are only now waking up to the reality that us Israelis have to face, those who still don't fully grasp what happened this weekend, and especially those who condone the actions of Hamas because they think this somehow justifies everything that happened for the past 75 years.

I want to preface this by saying I will be using two sources (Btselem and the UNOCHA) which hold an anti-Israel bias and as such do not accurately report deaths or distinguish between innocent civilians, combatants, and people participating in hostilities. As such, even though I am being incredibly generous with the total number of civilians killed by Israel, it doesn't even begin to make a dent in the horror we witnessed these past few days.

In addition I will not be counting Palestinian deaths that occurred after the attack on Israel in my calculation.

**Total Israeli deaths:**

While the number continues to rise as more bodies are found from towns along the border I will use 1,000 as the number of Israelis killed by Hamas in two days. In addition, I will not be making the distinction between Israeli civilians and solders in my calculation despite civilians making up the vast majority of deaths.

Btselem: According to data by Btselem, it would have taken Israel [5 years](https://statistics.btselem.org/en/all-fatalities/by-date-of-incident?section=overall&tab=overview&nifgaSensor=%5B%2275c9ac7%22%5D&dateSensor=%221528416000000%2C1695848399000%22) (2018-2023) to kill as many people as Hamas killed in two days. If we filter out Palestinian combatant deaths, it would have taken Israel [9 years](https://statistics.btselem.org/en/all-fatalities/by-date-of-incident?section=overall&tab=overview&nifgaSensor=%5B%2275c9ac7%22%5D&dateSensor=%221406678400000%2C1695848399000%22&combatSensor=%5B%221%22%5D) (2014-2023) to kill as many civilians as Hamas killed over the past two days.

UNOCHA: According to data by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, it would have taken Israel [5 years](https://i.imgur.com/jbSeXqZ.png) (2018-2023) to kill as many people as Hamas killed in two days. If we filter out Palestinian combatant deaths, it would have taken Israel [6 years](https://i.imgur.com/WYhR4ks.png) (2017-2023) to kill as many civilians as Hamas killed over the past two days.

**Other comparisons:**

Deir Yassin: Hamas killed ten times as many Israelis in two days as Palestinians who were killed in Deir Yassin.

9/11: Hamas killed a third of the total of deaths on 9/11 in two days.

This is the same number of Israeli deaths that occurred during the entire 5 years of the Second Intifada.

**Proportionately 1,000 murdered Israelis is like:**

* 34,300 Americans
* 8,549 Germans
* 6,935 Brits
* 6,673 French
* 4,429 Ukrainians
* 4,120 Canadians
* 2,646 Australians

After looking at this data I think it puts the argument of what the reality here is to rest. Israel (despite being able to cause significantly more death to the Palestinians) has taken unthinkable measures to prevent their deaths despite knowing what would happen if they ever managed to breach its defenses. As for Hamas and their supporters, it shows what they would do if there was nothing stopping them.



Based on data from the UN, 40-80% of Palestinians that were killed since 2008 were civilians (1582 are disputed). According the same data (and adding 900 deaths from this weekend) close to 82% of Israelis killed since 2008 were civilians.

With the power disparity taken into account it just shows how much Israel has done to prevent civilian casualties whilst highlighting the complete disregard for civilian lives by Palestinian groups.",10/10/23 12:38:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/174k4vq/hamas_has_killed_more_civilians_in_two_days_than/,244,315,553,Israel,top,all
172a3do,An open letter to the Palestinian people,"Dear Palestinians,

  
You have lost.

  
You have lost your perceived moral high ground because there is no excuse this time. This wasn't in response to or in retaliation for anything. There's no ""Israel started it"" this time. This was a well planned, well coordinated, and well funded military style incursion into a sovereign nation. 

  
You have lost your perceived moral high ground because of the utter barbarism that is on display. There are no strategic objectives and this isn't about borders or territory. This is about causing as much carnage in the civilian population as possible. Terrorists are rampaging through the streets of several Israeli towns and cities, murdering people at random. They are kidnapping women, children, and the elderly and dragging them back to Gaza to be tortured, or they are torturing them right where they are. They are desecrating their bodies and dragging them through the streets while other Palestinians spit on their corpses and yell ""Allahu akbar!"" while they celebrate their ""brave"" victory.

  
You have lost because public sentiment will shift after this. Aside from the worst regimes on the planet, like Iran and Russia, there is unanimous international condemnation of this terrorist invasion. Countries won't dare this time to issue calls for restraint. People all over the world are waking up and looking at the videos with horror, and you can bet they will think twice about posting an inane comment about ""freedom fighters"" or ""ending the apartheid."" Moderate progressives, who have been on your side until now, will question what they have been supporting. 

  
You have lost because Israel will not tolerate this and will bring the full force of the IDF down on your heads. Many innocent Palestinians will die, and you have Hamas to thank for that. Israel will not only send a clear message that this won't be tolerated, but they will do everything in their power to make sure something like this can never happen again. I shudder to think of what Gaza will face in the coming days and weeks.

  
My only hope is that the peace-loving, tolerant among you will hunker down and stay safe. And when the dust settles you wake up and realize that if you want a future for your people, you must get out from under the boot of Hamas and demand change.",07/10/23 16:15:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/172a3do/an_open_letter_to_the_palestinian_people/,247,1394,388,Israel,top,all
178hxo9,I’ve grown tired of “taking sides.” What’s happening in Israel and Palestine is a tragedy.,"My in-laws are all displaced Palestinian-Christians, part of the Palestinian diaspora that migrated to North America after the six day war. They are good people. Non-violent, hard working, I’d consider them part of the American success story. At the same time, I, a white, middle age, American man have been blessed enough to have close friendships with Jewish people and Israelis alike. I’ve visited both Israel and the West Bank. I mourn for the terrorism inflicted on Israel and her people. At the same time, I know Israel will and must defend its civilians and that defense will result in the infliction of death and violence on innocent Palestinian civilians. There are no winners here. And the side-taking is extremely counterproductive. If there were a “bad guy” in this scenario, I’m convinced it’s Hamas which has done nothing to further the interests of the Palestinian people and with each terror attack on Israeli civilians is regressing the Palestinian cause. To this day have very close friends and family in the West Bank. I am sympathetic to Palestinians but we have to take a step back, stop taking sides and acknowledge there are innocent civilians on both sides of the conflict that are being hurt here - and this is an all around human tragedy.",15/10/23 15:34:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/178hxo9/ive_grown_tired_of_taking_sides_whats_happening/,238,183,214,Israel,top,all
18m59m3,Aren't Arabs the ultimate Colonist?,"https://youtu.be/KP-CRXROorw?si=Nf0rMU6O477EjZQK

Bill Maher points out in his ""New Rules"" monologue that the Jews have been kicked out of every Arab country. He also points out that the Muslims are one of the greatest colonizers in all of history. But unlike Britian, Spain and the other European empires, they never gave back the land.

The Jews have a 3200 year old claim to the land. Muslims have a 1300 year old claim. The Jews took it from other people. 

Lebanon was mostly Christian, but was taken over by Islamn in the last 70 years. It was once the Jewel of the Middle East and is now a poverty-riden, violent, Islamafascist hell hole. 

Do I agree with every Israel has done? Of course not. (I'm not Jewish and have no affinity to the Jewish people. I have many Muslim friends.) 

The demand for the Jews to give up a Jewish state when it is surrounded by Islamist dictatorships is anti-jewish, no matter how you try to justify it. The arab-muslim groupthink is a delusion encouraged by the blue-haired mafia on US college campuses who are blinded by Marxist theology they don't even understand, but that is popular on tic Tok. 

The Palastinians (a non-distinct ethnic group without a historically distinct culture any more than settlers in the West bank have) are pawns of Jew haters in the Arab world  like Hamas is the pawn of Netanyahu (but he played with fire and got burned).

It's time to get realistic and compromise. Israel holds the cards. 

Violence will not win the day for Palestinians. They are cannon fodder, expendable losses for the billionaires smoking hookah in Qatar while they sacrifice pawns without a strategy to actually win anything. The enrich themselves with funding for fight they hope they never win. 

The Arab Muslim world doesn't want victory for the Palastinians - they want the conflict. It justifies their hatred.

Indian hacking groups stepped up their attacks on Hamas and Palestine to defend the systems and crucial digital assets of the country. In an attempt to hit back at the Palestinian terror group, Indian hackers took down the Palestinian National Bank and the National Telecommunications Company.

After attacking the national assets of the country, Indian hackers decided to make Hamas their next target, hacking into and disabling their official website. Indian hackers delved into a cyber war with Palestine to defend the systems of Israel, which already has its cyber security walls up high.

1aljo2k,A Foreign Perspective,"I am an American, and I am a Christian. I have no ties to Judaism, nor Islam. I didn’t know much about the conflict until October 7th.

On the 7th, I had a friend of mine murdered in the attacks. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was raped, beaten, and humiliated, but I’ve done my best to ignore it. I know she passed, and I want to remember her for who she was. She was attending the festival.

That caused me to do two things, become extremely emotionally-charged against Hamas, and become educated about the conflict. I have spent months now indulging myself far down the rabbit hole. I’ve read every thread, watched every video, read every Wikipedia page, and spent hours perusing the Israel Times and Al Jazeera alike.

Originally, I was against Hamas, and not Palestine as a whole or its supporters. But the reaction online has riled me up to the point where I am desensitized and honestly full of hatred. I am not afraid to admit it. I HATE the other side. I don’t hate Palestinian civilians, and I don’t believe in an eye for an eye, but I have lost all ability to sympathize.

I know that history didn’t start on the 7th. I know everyone has dozens of arguments for both sides. I just honest to God cannot understand why Palestine feels they have any leeway at all to argue. They have lost every single war they’ve waged against Israel, and yet still kept their territory. They elected a terrorist organization immediately after Israel left Gaza. They routinely send rockets across the border, over and over and over again. And to top it all off, the civilian casualties are due to Hamas hiding behind civilians and underground. They are cowards, and they don’t care about their own people.

My main issue is the nonexistent accountability. “Israel did this, Israel did that, Israel is a colonial state.” I have never seen someone say “you know what, Hamas has done nothing but harm the potential of Palestine as a whole.” It all Israel’s fault. All the time.

I’m not even going to get into the individual words such as genocide because I think you can infer my stance based on this post. I don’t want civilians to die, I just want the Palestinian side to admit that they have a hand in this, and that they can’t blame big bad Israel for every thing that is wrong with their country. I hope the war ends sooner rather than later, but until Hamas unconditionally surrenders and abdicates, I’ve lost all ability to care. 

I know this makes me sound like an evil person. I think I am saying the quiet part out loud that a lot of people want to but are afraid to, which is reasonable. I just want to hear your thoughts.",08/02/24 01:28:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1aljo2k/a_foreign_perspective/,233,479,477,Israel,top,all
17jsw26,"Start the conversation with ""Does Israel deserve to exist"".","People are having debates about the intricacies of history, war, and conflict when it comes to Israel/Palestine, and not surrounding the reality of 2023. People will debate who started what, in what war, and when....but does any of that even matter?

What matters is this: **Does Israel deserve to continue its existence as a state**?

This is where the conversation needs to start, and this is an easy way to save yourself a ton of time. Don't sit there and debate people on the nuance of Israel and Palestine relations if their overarching opinion is ""Israel should be destroyed"". What this does is force these Palestinian supporters out into the open; you don't get to go off into the weeds in a debate, talking about proportionality and occupation, when you're secretly in favor of destroying the only Jewish state on planet earth. 

If we can agree that Israel deserves to exist, then we can talk. Then we can debate on what land should be ceded and what laws should be implemented...but we need to start from a place everyone agrees before we do any of that.

17n6gkg,I’m convinced biggest mistake the Palestinians ever made was filming the October 7th attacks.,"Palestinian Government is Hamas. Hamas’ strongest war tactic is losing terribly in the actual battle, but gaslighting the world to earn victim points by portraying the winner (🇮🇱)as a monster to increase antisemitism worldwide. 

“How could they attack our human shields?” They cry.

This is Hamas’ true goal: to make life harder for Jews around the globe.

Since the October 7th attack was very aggressive and not aligned with victimhood, then filming the attack only hampered the Hamas mission of acquiring victim points. 

Big mistake. There should have been a better strategy.. even if that strategy was not filming in order to gain plausible deniability.

Now I’m hearing the new Palestinian lie which Is that Israel created Hamas.

They are very very desperate and clearly don’t want to win the actual war, they just want to win the war of misinformation.

1779t7g,I’m Going to War for Israel. Palestinians Are Not My Enemy,"By Nir Avishai Cohen

I was in Austin, Texas, for work on Saturday when I received a call from my commander in the Israel Defense Forces to return to Israel and head to the front line. I didn’t hesitate. I knew that the citizens of my country were in real danger. My duty first and foremost is to join the fight against those who unleashed a massacre on my people. I boarded the first flight I found out of Austin to head home to join the I.D.F. reserves, where I serve as a brigade operations command officer.

During my long flight to Israel, my mind couldn’t rest. I was trying to write down my feelings and thoughts about everything happening — and everything that’s about to happen — in my beloved country.

Little by little, the dimensions of the horrors of the most brutal attack that Israelis have experienced since the establishment of the state were being revealed. Hundreds of Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,200 people, including women, children and older people. About 150 citizens and soldiers have been taken captive. There’s nothing in the world that can justify the murder of hundreds of innocent people.

But I’d like to say one thing clearly, before I go to battle: There’s no such thing as “unavoidable.” This war could have been avoided, and no one did enough to prevent it. Israel did not do enough to make peace; we just conquered the Palestinian territories in the West Bank, expanded the illegal settlements and imposed a long-term siege on the Gaza Strip.

For 56 years Israel has been subjecting Palestinians to oppressive military rule. In my book “Love Israel, Support Palestine,” I wrote: “Israeli society has to ask itself very important questions about where and why the blood of its sons and daughters was spilled. A Messianic religious minority has dragged us into a muddy swamp, and we are following them as if it were the piper from Hamelin.” When I wrote these words last year, I didn’t realize how deep in the mud we were, and how much more blood could be shed in so little time.

I am now going to defend my country against enemies who want to kill my people. Our enemies are the deadly terrorist organizations that are being controlled by Islamic extremists.

Palestinians aren’t the enemy. The millions of Palestinians who live right here next to us, between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan, are not our enemy. Just like the majority of Israelis want to live a calm, peaceful and dignified life, so do Palestinians. Israelis and Palestinians alike have been in the grip of a religious minority for decades. On both sides, the intractable positions of a small group have dragged us into violence. It doesn’t matter who is more cruel or more ruthless. The ideologies of both have fueled this conflict, leading to the deaths of too many innocent civilians.

As a major in the reserves, it is important to me to make it clear that in this already unstoppable new war, we cannot allow the massacre of innocent Israelis to result in the massacre of innocent Palestinians. Israel must remember that there are more than two million people living in the Gaza Strip. The vast majority of them are innocent. Israel must do everything in its power to avoid killing innocent people and to focus on destroying the militant army of Hamas.

This war, like others before it, will end sooner or later. I am not sure I will come back from it alive, but I do know that a minute after the war is over, both Israelis and Palestinians will have to reckon with the leaders who led them to this moment. We must wake up and not let the extremists rule. Palestinians and Israelis must denounce the extremists who are driven by religious fanaticism. The Israelis will have to oust National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and their far-right circle from power, and the Palestinians will have to oust the leadership of Hamas.

I try to look for shreds of hope. The Yom Kippur War, the most difficult war that Israel had known until this week, started by surprise in 1973. After a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt was finally signed in 1979, the border with Egypt — one that was once the site of the dead and wounded — became a border of peace.

Israelis must realize that there is no greater security asset than peace. The strongest army cannot protect the country the way peace does. This current war proves it once again. Israel has followed the path of war for too long.

At the end, after all of the dead Israelis and Palestinians are buried, after we have finished washing away the rivers of blood, the people who share a home in this land will have to understand that there is no other choice but to follow the path of peace. That is where true victory lies.

nd0nev,Dear Israelis,"As a Palestinian, and after having discussions and open dialogues with several Israelis during the past couple of days, I couldn't help but notice that most Israelis are completely oblivious to the way we, as Palestinians, actually live.

I noticed that many of you are convinced that we live a normal modern life with the capability to improve ourselves as a society, economically, and technologically, but are CHOOSING not to do so.

I'm not talking about hatred or violence or anything like that. I'm talking about LAWS.

It's completely understandable that you wouldn't know your country's laws that don't concern you. I mean, no one reads laws for fun! You read the laws that apply to you out of necessity, and you ignore the ones that don't apply to you. That's normal!

But I think it's time for you to seriously get some understanding of the conditions that we live in, as Palestinians, just a few miles away from you, and WHY Israel is considered an Apartheid state and how these laws affect every aspect of our lives.

I thought this new video by AJ+ does a great job at explaining the situation in a friendly, non-bias, simple and illustrative manner:

1b5gr54,Why do people care so much about this?,"Why do people care more about I/P than these? 

Syria - Bashar al-Assad killed at least 300,000 of his citizens and forced at least 4 million additional citizens to seek refuge outside Syria

Yemen - at least 150,000 were killed in Yemen because of a war started by the Houthis. (Some of these protestors even cheered when the Houthis attacked foreign ships.)

Sudan - at least 200,000 Sudanese have been killed in the conflict there

China - China has imprisoned a million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims into forced labor.

Is it because Israel is Jewish?

Is it because Jesus is from Israel?

Is it because Jews are held to a higher standard than other peoples or religions?

Is it because people think Israel is white people and think Palestinians are not?

Any reasons at all? This is what’s on the news, this is what everyone’s talking about. I don’t see people asking Chinese people around the world about their fighting, but you see every Jew being asked about Israel. 

I see everyone shoving their opinion down all the Jews throat, but nobody else. 

I see diaspora Jews feeling like they “have to take a side” but not anyone else. Some Jews have never even been to Israel themself, let alone ever lived there or served IDF, or been in government.

I see so much online hate for Israel/zionists/jews but not these other places. Even though it’s not like Israel is “anti Palestine” they’re just anti being terrorized, after Jews have been terrorized all of history. 

They’re being told they’re the nazis now, but this is nothing like nazi - Palestinians are armed and in their own state. Palestinians started a fight and then they get told they’re like Holocaust? 

Please explain it to me like I’m 5.

1bpio9x,I refuse to talk to my friends about this anymore ,"I’ve been an advocate for Palestinians since I was a kid, because I had two close childhood friends who were from East Jerusalem. Working in the intelligence field of the US Navy when I became an adult, I learned a lot about the details of both Israel and the PLO as well as Hamas. I don’t think what Israel is doing with Gaza is the correct solution to ensure that an attack like 10/7 never happens again, because there are so many deep rooted issues that need to be addressed to ensure that after Hamas is gone, the victims of this war don’t fall to the same radicalism as those who massacred civilians in October. 

However, that’s not what I came here to say. Its impossible to have a rational conversation with any of my friends anymore about this, from either point of view. The antisemitism is growing and has been absolutely rampant since the start of the war, but there’s also no way to voice concern for Israel’s historic and current treatment of Palestinian civilians without being labeled as a Hamas supporter. I see so many people I care about foam at the mouth falling victim to propaganda on both sides, and it’s disturbing. As a gay person, seeing my close friends call the Houthis (whose leader has called for the extermination of Jews) and Hamas “freedom fighters” is concerning. But so is seeing friends refer to Palestinian children as “terrorists”

Today, an influencer I like shared a photo of the “Franklin Prophecy”, and refused to believe me when I said it’s a forgery. But they can’t see the antisemitism!! 

It’s just impossible to tell anybody anymore that what they’re perpetuating is propaganda, because they refuse to see it and then write you off as a “genocide supporter” or a “terrorist supporter”. I can’t stand seeing otherwise rational people I’ve known for years be so ignorant. It’s not black and white. How can you get somebody to understand that Israelis speak Hebrew and Palestinians speak Arabic, so there’s an extremely high chance that if you’re “learning” something about this in an English corner of the internet — it’s *probably propaganda*??

182oijn,"If you don’t support the end of HAMAS you are not Pro-Palestine, just anti-Jew","I seriously dislike how calling HAMAS a genocidal terrorist organisation is a controversial statement. The evidence is presented right in front of you. The first line of the HAMAS charter states ‘Israel will exist ans will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it has obliterated others before it.’. Furthermore, the events on Oct. 7 have also shown the brutality of HAMAS, which is on par with ISIS and Al-Qaeda. 

And before anyone says the attacks were fabricated by the IDF, you are deluded. The footage was published by HAMAS themselves and they proudly claim these attacks. 

HAMAS also uses the Palestinian people as human shields so they can claim the morale high ground when people die. News flash: war is not a numbers game. The Germans lost more than the British and Americans combined in WW2, so can you say the Germans were victims? 

Peace in the Middle East will only come when both sides want peace. And for now, all I can see is that peace has been rejected vehemently by the terrorist orgs in the West Bank and Gaza.

18gj0qd,Gaza was an experiment in Palestinian statehood... it failed,"After reading some of the responses in the other thread ""Everybody always tells Israel what it shouldn't do , but nobody ever tells them what they should do"" I noticed a lot of replies saying ""return to the 1967 borders"" or ""dismantle the settlements"", as if that would put an end to Hamas and other terrorist groups' attacks on Israel. I find this incredibly naïve and fail to understand how you can come to this conclusion knowing the history of Israel's attempts at creating peace in the region. I've noticed that the pro-Palestinian side will make claims such as Gaza being an ""open-air prison"" Israel is an ""apartheid state"" etc. and when challenged on this and provided with the facts the usual response is, wait no they usually don't reply after that...  


Anyway let's lay down a few of the facts around Gaza:  


\- Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005 in an attempt to create peace.

\- 21 Israeli settlements were dismantled in the process, with over 8000 Jews forcefully removed from their homes. Up to October 7th not a single Jew, whether soldier or civilian were living Gaza.

\- Gaza was NOT initially blockaded by Israel, this was a gradual process that was put in place following suicide bombings and other attacks being launched into Israel from Gaza.

\- Since 2005 there have been rocket attacks into Israel every single year from Gaza, with significantly more fired following Hamas rise to power in 2007.

\- Aid sent from around the world to help build Gaza into a prosperous state was diverted into building rockets, digging tunnels and buying luxury homes abroad for Hamas' leadership.

\- Israel had been trying to reduce restrictions, offering thousands of work permits to Gazan civilians, many of which brought back information and layouts of civilian areas to Hamas to help them plan their massacres.  

\- Many of the Israelis living in communities near Gaza were left-wing types who volunteered to help the Palestinians in Gaza, including driving Gazan children to Israeli hospitals. Gazans thanked them by murdering them in their beds.  


So there you have it, Israel literally already did in Gaza what you are telling them to do in the West Bank. The result was 1400 Israelis brutally murdered, raped and kidnapped, with the constant daily threat of rocket attacks. And this is all from one small strip of land, imagine if Israel pulls out of the West Bank, much larger than Gaza and right next to the majority of Israel's main population centres, the threat to its civilians is significantly higher. 

Hamas doesn't govern the West Bank as they do in Gaza, but make no mistake, Hamas is in the WB too along with other equally anti-Semitic terrorist groups, and should Israel pull out of there completely there is no guarantee that a moderate Palestinian polity will take power. 

Gaza was the experiment in what an independent Palestine would look like, and after October 7th how could any Israeli trust that the same thing wouldn't happen on an even larger scale in the West Bank?  
As a non-Israeli, non-Jew I can see that is it is a ridiculous proposition to ask Israelis to put the lives of the majority of their citizens in danger for a fantasy. So why can't you?

18g4l0k,"Everybody always tells Israel what it shouldn't do , but nobody ever tells them what they should do","A popular argument I have seen against Israel is that they kill innocent civilians by going into gaza and eliminating Hamas for good . And don't get me wrong , killing innocent civilians is a bad thing and should never be justified  , but  maybe tell Israel what to do instead ? If Israel would have only listened to feedback , it would have probably just stood there after 7/10 and let things happen without doing anything because NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO , INNOCENT PEOPLE WILL GET KILLED . Israel doesn't do anything? Hamas just pulls out another 7/10 . Israel attacks Hamas back ? Innocent people in gaza get killed . Israel goes into gaza and starts destroying Hamas from it's roots ? Guess what , people will die .


The truth is , no matter how much Israel tries to do better , people will die.  That's the reality of war , especially when your enemy is using Schools and hospitals military bases and your own civilians as meat shields.

Instead of telling Israel what it shouldn't do , tell it what it should do . How exactly do people expect Israel to fight back against the people who kidnap and murder babies if they can't do anything meaningful against them ? Unless Israel makes the necessary sacrifices, 7/10 will happen again . And again . And again . Hamas leaders have literally said that they think it was a success and that they want to repeat it .

17wqtox,Here is the truth about israel,"Ive seen more and more voices about how israel would lose the fight horribly if not for usa.
Ive commented this and just wanted everyone to understand.

We would wipe both hamas and hezzbolla out of the fking map, their leaders living in bunkers in constant fear of the big ol Mossad who can pop out of nowhere.

Yemen launched a 300kg missile to israel which Israel intercepted out of the atmosphere.

Israel made a 3d model of a building full of terrorists and identified the number of terrorists in that building just by temperature.

You were all talking about iron dome , which is the past, now we are talking about iron beam ..a laser defense which will intercept missiles a second after they were launched, they will not be able to go beyond the enemys border.

Just so you know , we love peace, we are westerns by character, we went out of our way giving money to gaza for years so they can grow .
They never did , hamas chose killing, it just didn't know it chose to kill itself.

Think of it this way, if you are in the right , why would you live like a paranoid inside a bunker ?

188b9wn,Palestine exposes the limits of left wing thinking,"It's amazing this sub exists, somewhere for all of us to express ourselves on this elephant in the room topic (at least in the West). Really I'm talking about the media coverage in the West and the reactions to it, I won't condescend to lecture anyone who is actually involved.

One thing about this issue is scaring and fascinating me at the same time and that is:

How it exposes the moral hypocrisy of left wing thinking\*

\* By ""left wing thinking"" I mean the victim mindset, the rich v poor mindset. The Rich = immoral, poor = sympathetic victim attitude.

The reason is that this conflict is almost unique in the world, because you have a situation where a country that has all the trappings of the white, capitalist West is in direct conflict with one that has the characteristics of the origin countries of ethnic minority immigrants.

So Israel, at least in the left wing mindset, has the following characteristics

* Pale/ white skin
* Conspicuous wealth (associated with inequality and unfairness)
* Time for indulgence in leisure
* Sexual equality/ expressiveness/ individual expression/ indulgent and frivolous cultural expression (you get the point)
* A powerful and well equipped military with advanced technology

So it might as well literally be the United states. It might as well literally be that neighbour who has more money than you and went to a better school and had all the breaks and it's so unfair.

Meanwhile, the Palestinians have the following characteristics:

* Brown skin
* An exotic, mystical cultural identity
* Visible poverty, lack of access to luxury
* Don't have time for fun or frivolous timewasting because they are too busy scrounging a living and struggling to make ends meet
* Have no military, instead just being have a go heroes without the advantages of technology or big budget equipment - making them physical underdogs
* Very homogeneous community, little individual expression or indulgence

This makes them basically the same as the ethnic minority immigrant communities that we are indoctrinated almost from birth to obsess over defending. They are equivalent to the poor, put-upon victims who are defined by racist oppression

Left wing people cannot see past their own emotional reactions to these characteristics. They cannot look at the difference between Israel and Palestine without emotionally linking it to the ""rich vs poor"" ""white vs racist"" narratives from their own societies. 

Just like when they look at their own societies, they can't grapple with the following questions:

* Why do the Israelis have so much wealth and power? Maybe it's something they did right and not solely an unfair reflection of unearned privilege?
* What are the consequences of Palestinian decision making? Could it be that they have brought some of this situation on themselves?

They are just, fundamentally, emotionally incapable of looking at the Palestinian situation and giving them any agency for their own state. They are emotionally incapable of thinking about the Israeli point of view - they are rich, privileged, other.

They'll excuse the most extreme acts on the Palestinian side because their morality stems at a deep level from this concept of societal privilege. This is also why they don't care about Arab deaths in things like the Syrian Civil war, there's no rich oppressor to blame it on.

But it's so circular. The Palestinians keep getting rewarded for their mistakes and defeats. They get zero responsibility to look at the consequences of their actions, or to compromise, or move on, or look at the Israeli point of view. Nothing bad can be felt around any part of Arab society, because they're poor and therefore get a moral pass. Would the left feel the same way if they were the ones with the wealth, the military, and the conspicuous consumption?

Israel is rich. In the left wing mindset that makes it exploitative and unequal by nature. There is no thought that this wealth may be because their society functions better. Because Western people haven't experienced true societal failure. They have the privilege to focus on wealth inequality because there are not more severe issues to deal with, so this is how they see the world as a whole. 

And they can never escape. They are doomed by this mindset, for life, because no one questions it. No one pushes back on the positive value of a society that promotes wealth and prosperity.

The big problem is that left wing people are so wrapped up in this, once they've decided that a group is the ""victim"" then that group is entirely absolved of all moral responsibility, and there is no end to the double standards they will apply defending it. It really needs to be called out.

We really need to look at each case on its merits.

And here we have a case of a war where a group has done the following:

* Stated it wants to destroy a country (more so, a culture)
* Knowing that that country has a much more powerful military, controls access to water and fuel, and has a doctrine of ""an Eye for an Eye""
* Gone out and murdered over a thousand of their innocent civilians in cruel and degrading ways
* Placed military defences under residential areas and hospitals

There are consequences to these actions. The consequences for these actions are Palestinian deaths. This must be called out, but left wing people won't because they live in a fantasy world where ""the rich"" (which is always someone else mind) always have to defer to ""the poor"", because poverty is the fault of the rich.

It's limited, it's shallow, it's not big it's not clever, but it's all over elite institutions, like the media, across the West. It's so rare to get a platform to call it out

17rmdwa,My testimony,"**Ask me anything.**

I'm a 33-year-old Israeli. I live in Tel Aviv with my wife, a 7-month-old daughter, and a dog. For more than a decade, Hamas has been firing rockets at us. I don't want to raise kids like this. I want to live.

We just moved to a new building. Some construction workers are from Gaza. They came here daily to work. The attack stopped them from doing so.

The people of Gaza also worked in towns close to the border. They shared intelligence for these towns. People who were ""part of the family.""

[A testimony](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzZc8auI0Qz/?igshid=YzhibHd4eDl1MjJ2) of Hamas terrorist what was the actual use of Shifa hospital.

Condemning ""violence"" while using violence can appear hypocritical. Unless, well, you don't have a problem with violence. You don't like Jews. [see report](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzY9IW2oM8u/).

As an Israeli, I care for my arab Israeli friends, and it goes both ways. Hamas murdered both Jews and Arabs. They didn't care who you are. And now, in Europe, Jews are being hunted. They don't live in Israel. Only Jews.

Wow I couldn’t expect the amount of reactions to this post.
Thank you for all the love.
Few points I’d like to add, as it is hard to reply in person. 
I’m a real person, I couldn’t post it if I used my identity, and I’m just found Reddit again in the last few weeks.
I care for Gaza people. But I care for my people more.
That being said, we are proud of having Bagatz which is high court of justice of Israel and it often critique the administration and overrule its desertions if there’s any doubt and for sure it won’t allow war crimes to happen. Also there’s a clarity and Israel administration keeps sharing dash videos from Gaza. You see there rockets at schools. Hospital, etc. Also you may see Israeli army escorts Gaza people to the south. 
I hope Gaza people will find new place to stay at, because their actions forced Israel to clear Gaza from Hamas and it will take some time to prevent massive casualties from our side.
Also don’t listen to Gaza officials with numbers, they caught on lies multiple times and international, check bbc.

17jae6r,"The Arab world doesn't care for Palestinians, it only cares about hating Jews.","October 7th happened, the Arab world denied it by saying it's all fake news. Then when more details came out such as people were beheaded, executed and families were burned in masses, the Arab world once again denied it all calling it propaganda. Then, the facts came in form of videos (taken by the terrorists), aftermath pictures and detailed forensic evidence the Arab world couldn't deny it any longer and instead justified it by blaming Israel for forcing the gazans hands. 

Now, that Israel is responding appropriately and justifiably the Arab world can't comprehend it. Not only are they all pushing actual fake news and propaganda, they also choose to hurt Jews around the world as if they have anything to do with the conflict. You have these fanatics all around the world going after Jews. In Europe, Asia, Eastern Europe and North/South America.(latest attempt in Russia where muslims are literally looking for Jews to hurt) and not to mention all the places around the world where Jews are apparently no longer allowed.

The Arab world doesn't care for Palestinians, they only care about hurting Jews. This conflict is not about Israel and Palestine. This conflict is about the Arab world looking for a reason to get rid of jews world wide.

n91i9m,I’m tired.,"I’m so tired of talking about Zionism and what’s been going on in East Jerusalem with the people around me. It is of my personal opinion that both sides are in the wrong here. I don’t believe the Palestinians in Sheik Jarrah should be evicted, but all these violent riots, supporting Hamas, saying to “send rockets to Tel Aviv, and attacks against Israelis and Jews are not a proper or good response to all of this. I denounce the suffering that Israel has caused the Palestinians and am sickened by the Levana/alt-right groups rioting and saying “kill all Arabs” and their attacks on Palestinians. But whenever I say that I think both sides are in the wrong in this case, I get “HOW DARE YOU SUPPORT THESE PALESTINIANS WHO ARE ATTACKING US! YOU’RE A JEW!” on one side and “HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT WHAT PALESTINE IS DOING IS NEARLY AS BAD AS WHAT ISRAEL IS DOING! THEY NEED TO RIOT TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE OPPRESSORS AND OCCUPIERS!” on the other. Theories of how Israel is actually trying to get Palestinians to do awful things so they can wipe them out and justifying violent riots on one end, and denial of Palestinian suffering and their right to be here on the other. None of this is helped by the fact that I currently live around 5 min away from Sheik Jarrah and that friends of mine are being harassed and beat up on for no reason. I fear going outside alone and the Old City is off limits, considering how most of the riots are happening there and rocks are being thrown from the Temple Mount to people at the Kotel. Here’s my final thought on all of this because I’m mentally burnt out from talking about this. I do not support the Israeli government’s treatment of the Palestinians and the eviction of those in Sheik Jarrah. I don’t support the PA and Hamas in terms of teaching people to hate and kill and encouraging it through things like the Martyr Fund. I believe in the right to a Jewish homeland in our homeland, which is eretz yisrael. I believe Palestinians can and should be citizens in this state, if they refuse, they can have there own state, provided that holy sites aren’t destroyed and we can have access to them (like the Grave of Rachel and the Cave of the Patriarchs) and that things remain at peace. A combination state where all are welcome is also good, as long as we can visit our holy sites and things stay peaceful. That’s all I want. Peace. Both Israeli and Palestinian governments commit atrocities and are corrupt. Both people need to calm down and stop hating each other, lest this hateful cycle continues. I’m honestly scared of a third intifada.

18swjly,HOW TO CRITIQUE ISRAEL WITHOUT BEING ANTISEMITIC: A GUIDE,"I am reposting this thread I saw on Instagram. It’s extremely accurate IMO. If it reaches one person and changes their tone when talking about this conflict, it will be worth all the hate I am certain most antisemites are about to spew at me for this

————————————————————————

THERE IS NOTHING MORE ZIONIST
THAN CRITIQUING ISRAEL AND
ITS POLICIES.

Israelis and Jews in the diaspora are no
strangers to pointing out Israel's
shortcomings, faults, or even egregious
behaviors.

In fact, for the last year and a half, Israelis
have exercised their democratic rights,
taking to the streets in droves to protest
Netanyahu and the judicial reform.

PROTESTING, CRITIQUING, AND WORKING TO BETTER YOUR COUNTRY IS SOMETHING ISRAELIS, NO MATTER THEIR
SKIN COLOR, RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION. OR FAMILY BACKGROUND EMBRACE AND
REGULARLY PRACTICE. SO NO, CRITICIZING ISRAEL IS NOT INHERENTLY ANTISEMITIC. BUT THERE IS A FINE LINE, SO WE'LL SPELL OUT SOME SCENARIOS FOR YOU.

NOT ANTISEMITIC:
Supporting Palestinian liberation &
freedom of movement.

ANTISEMITIC:
Denying or defending the massacre
perpetrated by Hamas on October 7, who
employed tactics such as rape, burning people alive, torture, execution, and grenades to brutally ended the lives of over 1,200 Israelis, and abduct 230+ more, including foreign nationals from over 27 other countries, beginning the current Israel-Hamas war.

NOT ANTISEMITIC:
Criticizing the current Israeli Prime Minister and his policies.

ANTISEMITIC:
Calling Israel an apartheid, colonialist, Nazi
state, thereby erasing Jewish indigenous
history, as well as 2 million Arab Israelis
who make up 21.1% of the country, and
600,000 non-Arab Christians, Baha'i,
Samaritans, Seventh-day Adventists,
Messianic Jews, and Jehovah's Witnesses.
While there is work to be done regarding
prejudice between communities, all citizens
of Israel have equal rights under the law.
Also, Holocaust comparisons, especially
comparing a Jew to Hitler, is inherently antisemitic.

NOT ANTISEMITIC:
Disagreeing with statements made by
Israelis or Israel supporters

ANTISEMITIC:
Saying you don't hate Jews, you just hate
""Zionists"". The vast majority of Jews
around the world consider themselves to be
Zionists. Zionism is, simply put, the right of
the Jewish people to self-determination
and self-governance in their native
homeland. To deny this, and to use “Zionist""
as a dog-whistle for ""Jew"" is inherently antisemitic.

NOT ANTISEMITIC:
Grieving for innocent Palestinians killed
in the war.

ANTISEMITIC:
Refusing to hold Hamas, the PIJ, the PLO,
and PA accountable for their years of terror
against Israel, war crimes, instigation of
this war and others, the breaking of previous ceasefires, and horrific treatment of their own people, including but certainly not limited to using innocent civilians as human shields, theft and embezzlement of humanitarian aid funds and resources, religious cleansing of Christian Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza, and threatening and enacting violence onto their people.

NOT ANTISEMITIC:
Speaking out against discrimination of Jews
of colour. 

ANTISEMITIC:
Claiming all Jews are white colonizers from
Europe. This erases Mizrahi, Sephardi,
Yemenite, Ethiopian, Indian, and Asian
Jewish history, as well as the history of Jews
from other parts of the globe, and thereby
disregards the reality that over half of Israel's Jewry did not have experiences in Europe during the diaspora. It also, once again, erases Jewish indigeneity, which is proven through the revival of the ancient Hebrew language, archeological evidence, cultural evidence, and DNA, amongst others.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DISCARD FACTS,
HISTORY AND THE HUMANIZATION OF
JEWS TO STAND WITH PALESTINIANS.
IF YOU DO, YOU ARE NOT PRO PALESTINE,
YOU ARE JUST ANTI-JEWS.",28/12/23 15:30:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18swjly/how_to_critique_israel_without_being_antisemitic/,213,798,571,Israel,top,all

18bu36z,The U.S. pro-Palestine movement is MUCH more toxic and hateful than the pro-Israel movement....,"And I am really sick of pretending that it's not or trying to convince myself otherwise.

Until recently, I would have felt bad saying this. I didn't like when people would comment on how much more ""peaceful"" pro-Israel marches were than pro-Palestinian marches. Because even though I am pro-Israel, I am able to accept that Palestinians are OBJECTIVELY a more oppressed group than Israelis due to Western support and other factors. And I am a huge advocate of oppressed groups spreading awareness and being loud when they need to. During Black Lives Matter protests, immigration marches, etc.--for one, I never actually saw evidence of anyone who partook in things like those actually being violent or aggressive. And if they had been accused of being those things, I would have defended the HECK out of those groups, because they were LITERALLY fighting for their lives. I also think that calling out movements run mainly by POC as being ""not peaceful"" or ""aggressive"" has racist connotations in and of itself.

But with all that being said, I simply cannot get over the fact that the pro-Palestine population in the U.S. is SIGNIFICANTLY more toxic, vile, hostile, and aggressive than the pro-Israel population. And many of the people in the pro-Palestine movement are not even Palestinian, Arab, or Muslim. I am sick of not recognizing this and the movement not being held accountable for it.

Here are some things that I have seen the pro-Palestine movement do that I have NEVER seen any member of the pro-Israel community do even close to. And cannot be excused by any the spewing of words such as ""genocide"" ""apartheid"" ""colonialism"" etc.

* Straight-up celebrating vicious attacks on civilians and accusing said civilians--even literal children--of being ""complicit"" in ethnic cleansing as settlers and implying it was deserved
* Shaming people for mourning after said attacks. Attacking celebrities who dared to show sympathy for Israeli people after several of them were massacred
* Shaming anyone who posts anything wanting peace for civilians on BOTH sides of the conflict, screaming things like ""stop both-sides-ing! It's pro-Palestine or anti-humanity!"" As if Israelis aren't people as well
* Accusing anyone who is rightfully worried about antisemitism of ""centering themselves"" or ""overreacting""
* When actual antisemitic incidents take place, finding every excuse to claim that there is nothing that could be done. When people literally held up Nazi signs at the University of Wisconsin, people commenting on Instagram posts condemning these actions that ""it didn't take place exactly on campus, it's not really an attack on our students.""
* Attacking and mobbing Jewish-owned businesses or businesses that happen to be owned by Israelis. Turns out it's because owner ""donated to the IDF""--nope, donated to an Israeli medical fund. Apparently that's still unacceptable too! Apparently Israeli citizens don't deserve medical care and anyone who donates to such a cause should have their restaurant stormed!
* Pressuring people to cancel public Hanukkah celebrations, and when people are rightly upset about it, claiming that it was the fault of Jewish people for conflating antisemitism and anti-Zionism and that the organizers are doing it for their ""safety""
* Commenting ""Free Palestine"" on literally any post that happens to have a Star of David in it. On the anniversary of the Tree of Life shooting, several of the Pittsburgh sports teams posted in memory of the victims. All of those posts were flooded with ""Free Palestine"" comments and when called out for it, there were people saying that ""if they had the time to comment on something that happened 5 years ago, they had the time to comment on a genocide happening now"". Yeah, not like the reason they posted was because the shooting took place directly IN PITTSBURGH or anything...
* When an actual PRO-PALESTINE celebrity condemns antisemitism and reminds their followers that Jews are not responsible for what is going on, getting offended that they dare bring up the rise in antisemitism when there are ""more important things"" and even saying things like ""actually, we kind of do have to hold Jewish people accountable""
* Ripping down posters of hostages and getting aggressive with anyone who confronts them about it
* Infiltrating pro-Israel or pro-peace protests, grabbing flags, stepping on them, etc.
* Denying that rape happened, saying that ""they need evidence"" first, arguing that Hamas treated hostages well
* Shaming anyone who doesn't boycott EVERY business that has donated a single penny to Israel, claiming that people should be ashamed of themselves for buying things like Pampers, when some people may literally live in areas with limited stores and there are limited options for certain products
* Shaming people who literally have connections to both sides. I have a friend who has family who is Israeli AND family who is Palestinian. She feels absolutely lost and alone. When reaching out to pro-Palestine groups, she has been basically told she isn't wanted in their conversations because she is also concerned about her Israeli family and that she should be ""only standing with her Palestinian relatives."" She has not experienced any of this hate from pro-Israel groups she has reached out to.

And this isn't even half of what I've seen. But I'll stop rambling on.

I am looking for any justification of why the pro-Palestine movement is inexplicably vicious, or how any of these actions are actually helping to ""Free Palestine"". I have never seen even close to this level of hate from the pro-Israel movement. I understand that there are VERY LEGITIMATE concerns in Palestine, and there is nothing wrong with bringing attention to those concerns. People should march in solidarity without spreading hateful rhetoric, hold memoriam for the several Palestinians who have lost their lives, make donations and encourage others to do so, and boycott certain brands if they feel that is what is best for them. Nothing that is going on, however, excuses the amount of hate and vitriol I have seen in the examples I've mentioned above, and I have yet to see anyone tell me how this type of behavior actually helps Palestinians.

That is all.

The gist is this ProPally activist is shocked (SHOCKED!) when he finds out that the young Muslim women he marched with at the anti-Israel protest in London do not share his views on LGBTQ+ people.

It's quite the surprise when everybody pulls off their masks and progressives realize they are marching side-by-side with a bunch of retrograde religious fanatics who would, if they got their way, plunge the world into a primitive barbarous theocracy.

As a gay, I know that there are a lot of countries where I'm less than safe. Muslim countries top the list. It is no surprise to me that when the 🇵🇸wavers get to talking, some of them are going to have severely unflattering things to say about us LGBTQs, among many other things that would offend the sensibilities of most progressives, if they actually took the time to inquire.

17qp4wp,"Hamas to NYT: We hope for ""permanent war"" with Israel and don't aim to improve the situation in Gaza","The New York Times published an extensive [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/middleeast/hamas-israel-gaza-war.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) based on a series of interviews with senior Hamas officials. 

According to a member of the group’s Politburo, Khalil al-Hayya, who lives in Doha, the massacres committed by Hamas in Israel on October 7 were supposed to attract the attention of the whole world, and not least the Arab countries, to the Palestinian issue. who, according to him, gradually began to forget about it.

> “What could change the equation was a great act, and without a doubt, it was known that the reaction to this great act would be big” he says. But, he added, “We had to tell people that the Palestinian cause will not die.”

According Hamas' senior officials, the group's goal is not to improve living conditions in Gaza. In al-Hayya's words:

> Hamas’s goal is not to run Gaza and to bring it water and electricity and such. Hamas, the Qassam and the resistance woke the world up from its deep sleep and showed that this issue must remain on the table. This battle was not because we wanted fuel or laborers. It did not seek to improve the situation in Gaza. This battle is to completely overthrow the situation.

Instead Hamas seeks to create a permanent conflict. As Hamas media adviser Taher El-Nunu told the newspaper

> I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us.

Thousands have been killed in Gaza since the October 7th massacre. But, the New York Times concludes,

> [In] the bloody arithmetic of Hamas’s leaders, the carnage is not the regrettable outcome of a big miscalculation. Quite the opposite, they say: It is the necessary cost of a great accomplishment — the shattering of the status quo and the opening of a new, more volatile chapter in their fight against Israel.

Thus, for instance, Ghazi Hamad, another senior Hamas official, says (in a different interview though):

> Will we have to pay a price? Yes, and we are ready to pay it. We are called a nation of martyrs, and we are proud to sacrifice martyrs.

This took a near civil war within Israel, but was accepted for the chance of peace. I personally was there, part of the armed forces that forcefully evacuated the settlers and Jewish settlements in Gaza. 

The Gazan people, one way or another,  have chosen violence and continued aggression against Israel. While Israel has continued to build hospitals and power plants, orchestras and research labs, Gaza has chosen rockets, tunnels, and terrorism. 

It has been 17 years. An entire generation that could have been born into peace, has been born into Jihad. Fueled by Iranian money, Gaza chooses Hamas (“resistance”) and Jihad (“holy war”).

1afe4i5,Jenin Hospital,"At first glance, the thoughts that were going through my head were ""That's horrible. They lost my respect by doing this. Dressing up as Palestinian civilians and entering a hospital"". But then it hit me. I started to reason with myself and think ""Hold up. Why exactly is this a bad thing?"" I don't get it. They went in and did a stealth killing of 3 Palestinian militants. Isn't this what the world wanted as demonstrated by the ruling of ICJ? They wanted Israel to take more measures to minimize civilian casualties. Isn't this what was expected of IDF? I don't know if disguising as Palestinians and entering hospitals is a war crime, but even if it is, shouldn't this be considered a good thing since they didn't kill any civilians? So why is there hatred for this too?

Question for the people who are Pro Palestine: 
What tactics should the IDF ideally use? 

Reports have said that there were no civilian casualties in the Jenin hospital raid. All they did was take out the militants. And now online media is condemning that too? Well then what are they supposed to do? Lay around like sitting ducks and have their fingers crossed praying for another 07/10 not to happen? If Hamas fighters had carried out a raid on a hospital in a similar manner, I would've seen them being praised. It's like Israel is not allowed to win. So as far as tactic goes, it seems that Israel should actually be storming a public gathering and kill 1200 people as this was seen as acceptable before.

As the state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said ""Hospitals need to be protected but Israel has the right to bring the militants to justice."" 

IDF did both. So I feel this should be viewed as a win for both sides.

Edit :

I've seen multiple comments in this sub that are similar to each other so I'll provide my argument for some of them


Q1) Disguising yourself as a doctor / nurse / regular civilian is perfidy: 

A1) The whole purpose of the Israeli combatants wearing the disguise was to use the element of surprise. If they were wearing regular uniforms it would've alerted the militants and hence gunfights would've pursued in the hospital that also hosted innocent civilians. This should be viewed from a positive angle cuz this tactic is what allowed for 0 civilian casualties.

Q2) The militants were executed instead of arrested: 

A2) Arresting militants that are viewed as ""heroes"" in the west bank would've led to possible confrontation from civilians outside the hospital. The combatants would then have to use some kind of force to extract the arrested militants. An angry mob confrontation would've been inevitable.

Q3) Why was it frowned upon when Hamas disguised themselves as civilians? 

A3) because when Hamas does it, they kill civilians. The Israeli combatants did it for the sake of protecting the civilians. Wearing disguises in an open field is obviously an act of terror because the enemy might unintentionally harm an actual civilian. However, in this scenario the disguise was used in a closed infrastructure and the assassinations were conducted in stealth before enemy gunfire could be initiated.

1b8kypd,Why Jewish Voice for Peace is an abysmal representation of Jewish views on Israel,"I want to write this to educate well meaning people who are finding themselves opposed to Israel lately as well as to Jews who find themselves angry when Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) is raised by an anti Zionist as so called “proof” that Israel has nothing to do with Judaism and that many Jews hate Israel. 

Now, the purpose of this post is not to argue why JVP is a Jewish hate group masquerading as a “Jewish organization” that seeks the eradication of Israel.  If you are interested in that topic, Arnie Bernstein, a politically liberal Jew, articulated this truth quite well and you can read about it [here](https://aish.com/uncovering-the-real-voice-of-jewish-voice-for-peace/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAxaCvBhBaEiwAvsLmWOfu6tbcmw60lkCcT86e0LCX0WcYVeE8zI6coBjnzMQo-gr_rnNFfhoCcwQQAvD_BwE)

Instead, this post is to make clear that JVP is *not* reflective of Jewish views on Israel. A person who claims it is is either lying or incredibly ignorant.  Rather, support for Israel and Zionism is inextricably linked to Jewry and Judaism. What non Jews have trouble understanding about us is that we are a religion, ethnicity and nation wrapped into one. In the 1930s, there was an organization called the Association of German National Jews, and they supported Hitler.  Didn’t turn out well for them either:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_German_National_Jews?wprov=sfti1#

If you’re arguing to a Jewish person that JVP exists as an example why Israel isn’t an important to the Jews, you might as well put Kanye west out as the spokesperson for black people. There have always been a minority of ethnic Jews going against their own people in history. JVP is no different.

Jewish organizations that represent themselves as Zionist (basically all of them):

1) Jewish Federation
2) Anti Defamation League
3) American Jewish Comitee
4) Hillel International
5) Aish
6) Hadassa Women’s Zionist Organization of America
7) Chabad
8) AIPAC
9) Jewish Telegraphic Agency
10) World Jewish Congress
11) World Zionist Organization
12) B’Nai B’rith International

There are many more. Just the top four represent basically the most significant Jewish organizations in the US.  All Zionists. Vast majority support a two state solution too. 

So for those of you using JVP as an argument, realize that you are deeply insulting the Jews you’re speaking to when doing so. And for my Jewish friends who have to deal with nonsense, now you know how to respond.

17q7sws,It's taken me 4 weeks to work out Jews got there first,"Why do Pro Palestinian supporters insist on Jewish ""occupation"" when Judea was a country thousands of years before Islam and surrounding non-secular countries even existed? The state of Israel may be relatively new to Palenstine but surely if the argument is ""whoever got here first should have priority"" then Jewish ""settlers"" cannot rightly be described as ""colonists""; besides, wasn't the whole point of creating Israel to extract Jews from the communities where they were not welcome?

In respect of other peoples much stronger investment, I will explain I do believe Israeli response is barbaric and a disaster that will fail everyone, Israel included.

18vfyun,The Left sends a bad message to Palestinians,"The Left does a disservice to Palestinians

When I speak with many left wing pro-Palestine supporters, or with diaspora Palestinians, I often get a sense of anger and victimhood. The IDF is called the IOF, they refer to the 48 lands, and chant their river to the sea chants. 
The left should not be encouraging the idea that because 1948 was unfair, it follows Israel should be asked to dismantle itself. One Palestinian state from the river to the sea is not going to happen. People on the left need to recognize that Hamas, others groups with maximalist one state aims, those who don’t renounce violence, and terrorism, really don’t get a seat at the table, and can’t be taken seriously. 

Palestinians need to be reminded that as long as groups like Hamas are popular, Israel and most normal westerners will never support a blank check Palestinian state. It’s one thing to protest settlements, or to protest for civic freedoms, but if the destruction of Israel and tacit support for terrorism has to be bundled in with legitimate grievances, then the whole issue becomes tainted.
The best thing the left can do is validate the Palestinian historical tragedy, recognize it, and encourage moving past it towards a peaceful, obtainable end state.  I don’t see that happening, only people encouraging pipe dream proto-Hamas ideas, and encouraging everyone to defund Israel.

People do need to be reminded that the Palestinian response to Israel withdrawing troops and settlers from Gaza was rocket fire and Hamas. It doesn’t exactly make it easy for Israelis to support repeating the story in the West Bank. US funding to Israel pays for the Iron Dome system, which allows Israel to tolerate Hamas belligerence and go on with normal life. I would argue this approach has been a tragic mistake, and sent a message that a violent approach is ok. Anyone who actually cares about Israeli or Palestinian lives should recognize Israeli mistakes, but also remind Palestinians that violence begets a violent response.",31/12/23 20:09:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18vfyun/the_left_sends_a_bad_message_to_palestinians/,205,702,335,Israel,top,all

1bsswz6,"I used to support Palestine , Now I support israel , and you should too.","Before we start I would like to say the massacre of the 10,000 children of gaza , can in no way be defended by any means. THESE ARE INNOCENT CHILDREN.  Moreover I am an arab myself , and not a jew standing for zionism.

I used to support palestine , because I genuinely beleived the palestinians were oppressed , blameless , and that Israel was the perpetrator.  However after a deep dive .  I leaned away from this beleif.

1. There was never a "" Palestine "".  Firstly the palestinian people did not come into the israeli territories peacefully.  Once the jews left 2-3,000 years ago.  The Canaanites and various christian groups { samaritans , chalcedonians }  inhabited palestine. The arabs came during the Islamic invasions , and most of the natives did not convert , however the arabs did come as settlers { bedouins settled in palestine}.  So yes , at one point the arabs themselves were settlers.  Moreover for 400 years before the israeli occupation , palestine was occupied by the ottomans.

&#x200B;

* Palestine was under turkish-ottoman occupation for 400 years before the israeli nation was formed.  However most do NOT bring this up , because truthfully a lot of palestinian arabs have less issue with occupation , but the fact it is jews doing the occupation and not there fellow muslims.

\-  60-80% of israelis are arabs.   I have heard so many garbage claims that israelis are colonizers , or are whites.  The truth is the majority of the jews are mizrahi { arab jews}.  Before the muslim majorities of iraq , persia , syria , yemen , turkey , morrocco , tunisia , egypt , and lebanon begin to execute the jewish peoples.  Jews formed large percentages { With upto 20% of yemeni , central iraqis , syrians , and lebanese people being jewish}.  However during a series of exterminations the jewish people were left landless , jobless , and starving.  This led to the jewish communities of the arab world unifying , and creating a strong desire for a unified jewish state.  This is now a known fact through DNA analysis , that all jews do originate from the israeli areas , and are a ethnic group that dispersed.  Jews have been longing for the return to their holy land for 3,000 years. After the conclusion of the holocaust it was decided that a jewish state , would be created in "" palestine"".

* The nakkbah was a choice. Yes , it was a choice to leave palestine after the palestinians lost a war they provoked with the israelis.  Palestinian people had sold their land to israel , and had been compensated before the palestinian war , the israelis although not properly trained won the war.  The christians arabs , and MANY muslims stayed in Israel. Because the truth is , the nakkbah was not a genocide , but were arabs , refusing to live under a jewish state.  Many arabs stayed in israel , and are now treated with the same rights as jewish arabs , and have their own religious holidays and places protected.  If the christian palestinians were to move to the HAMAS controlled Gaza , they would undoubtly be executed.

\-  HAMAS IS A TERRORIST organization.  See if the palestinian freedom fighters werent iranian funded terrorists. I would support palestine.  But the truth is , once palestine becomes free. HAMAS will not help palestinian people. But will instead incite a political civil war , against the opposition party. HAMAS also supports islamic sharia , which would strip the palestinian women of most of their rights , and would also exclude the upto 15% of palestinian arabs that are christians. Sadly for palestine , palestine is not oil rich.  So if they do not educate their population { WOMEN }  , the country will have nothing to offer , and will end up as a poor warring proxy state of iran {  Which is Yemen }.

* If HAMAS was to be a free governing body they would not be of any help to the palestinian people , as they do not have any expierience properly managing any group of people. Palestine as a nation would be a failure. Lets also not foregt the executions HAMAS has held against women , gays , and christians.

\- After the mizrahi jews were executed , exiled , and stripped of properties. They still managed in a record 70 years to develop the most secular , wealthiest ( 3 rd ) , and educated state in asia. With a quality of life standard rivaling most of  europe , and a Per Capita GDP higher than france , or the UK.

* This feat is something  no arab country , even oil rich.  Was able to achieve without the import of foreign labor { no arab country rivals Israel in GDP PP }.
* Israel belongs to the jews , as west bank belongs to the arabs.  The jewish people trace their history to israel , as does the palestinians.  Both belong.

Throughout the last 75 years It was palestine that had not cooporated. Mainly due to the fact that arab muslims , historically have not liked jews. Israel even though attacked by over 5 arab countries in 1967 was victorious and returned sinai to egypt , while keeping the Golan Heights.  So the only place israel illegally occupies is the golan heights. But israeli occupation also saved the 50,000 ethnic druze from a near annihilation by ISIS in 2014.

* Israel has given HAMAS over 50 billion dollars , and instead of investing into the people of palestine , hamas instead bought missilles.  If israel did not have the iron dome , the amount of deaths in israel would be MONSTROUS. HAMAS has found a way to by pass the iron domes by causing hundreds of suicide bombings in israel , killing thousands of jews , arabs , and christians of Israel.
* In all honesty the Israeli state does not have the goal of killing all palestinians. They pulled out of palestine in 2006.  The "" Open Air Prison "" many supporters of palestine call gaza , is actually just what a HAMAS governed state looks like. HAMAS has turned palestine into a hell , and raised a generation of jihadis. Such as instating a hijab mandate in all schools , and even passing laws to restrict womens work rights.  HAMAS actually controlls gaza , israel pulled out in 2006. So the wall in gaza , is actually just a border , not a aparthied -segregated border.
* Moreover HAMAS openly calls for the massaccre of all jews { wonder why jews hate them??}

I feel for the palestinian people , and the jewish sentiment. The majority reason for the support of palestine is deeply just political.  Groups like the Houthis , and crippling governments like lebanons use the war in palestine to garner international attention away from their own crippling governments , and connect the war to a growing unified arab sentiment , and rising islamic tolerance. This war is a greater battle between muslim countries , and secular nations.

&#x200B;

In a Ideal world where a democratic state of palestine could be created. I would love to support that , but however the truth is a independent palestine would just be the next afghanistan. In reality Israel must establish a democratic autonomous palestine , with exclusion from jewish rule. But Palestine as a country in this time , cannot exist.

I wish there is a permanent ceasefire , but I also know radicalism is growing in palestine , and another cycle of history will happen. Moreover palestinians already live in jordan , and have a semi-palestinian majority state. So therefore I beleive that jewish people also need a land and "" from the river to the sea"" is just an excuse to evict the jews AGAIN?.

**I'd love opinions from both sides , to better my understanding of this issue!!**

&#x200B;

Quick thing to add : The palestinians left israel during the Nakba , because arab leaders encouraged them too stating that the arabs "" will destroy israel "" so they should leave temporarily. However israel won , and fully integrated the arabs that stayed. However the arabs who fleed and supported the annihilation of the jews were given jewish controlled land "" palestine "" as a place to stay , but not given israeli citizenship. Palestinians choose to oppress themselves. Over 2 million muslim palestinians live in israel peacefully , and with love for the jews and christians. Jews celebrate eid with them , and integrated them into soceity as "" israeli arabs"". A funny thing is many jews have actually been arabized , with the popularity of arab culture in israel.   The reason palestine even exists , is because 2/3 arabs choose to listen to muslim leaders who abandoned them when the arabs lost , and israel was not tolerating anti-semites in their nation. However israel was very leniant , and gave protections to the 1/3 that stayed in israel. Jewish people tend to use logic and many are irreligious , whereas muslims use faith.  This is a known fact as a muslim myself. We tend to be more irrational and make decisions purely in support of our faith , over logic.

The Palestinians who share on this sub in good faith have done more to change my mind on the subject than anything else.

I can't lie and say that I don't have my own personal interests in the matter and that I am not biased. There are certain things about the conflict that I still struggle with, and sometimes I still see red when discussing really sensitive issues. Nonetheless there are Palestinian people who show up here almost every day and put themselves out there with what I consider to be extreme grace and patience, and at least on my end, it has really worked to change my perspective.

I think the most devastating thing about this conflict is that it dehumanizes people, but in spite of all the BS I still view a working peace as a real possibility, and something I think might happen much faster than people give it credit for. I don't really know what steps can be taken towards it other than what is outlined in the pinned ""8 Pragmatic Steps"" article, and I always think this sub will be something of a circle jerk, but it can be really cathartic to come here and see differing viewpoints expressed in a rational way versus the emotional hate I feel has become widespread.

I spoke to a woman on tiktok. Someone who was denying the death of elderly and babies. She asked for proof, i provided it. And still, she justifies everything by saying her people are oppressed. I don’t care wether you think you’re oppressed or not. There will never be any justification of what hamas did. Sending videos/images of the dead to their families members is cruel and disgusting, let alone posting it online for thousands of people to see. 

This dilemma of not *everything* israel claimed to have had happen is photographed/recorded is causing pro-hamas/pro-Palestine supporters to take it and run off by saying it’s fake. The Israelis aren’t the ones of recording the crime. They record the aftermath. Why does israel have to release a video of Hamas raping women/girls in order to prove they raped women? Why do they have to prove that babies were killed? Are the grieving mothers not enough? Palestinians proudly record themselves committing barbaric crimes. If you support Palestinians, why aren’t you believing them when they send out these types of photos/videos?

> Farsakh said the Red Crescent felt “helpless” as they waited for three hours for their ambulance to be given permission to access the location. She said: “We contacted the ministry of health and they coordinated our safe access with the Israeli authorities. We were given the green light to move the ambulance.” 

>But she said the ambulance came under fire soon after it arrived at the location. “First [the paramedics] said the Israeli forces are putting laser lights on them … And then we heard a gunfire sound before we lost the connection. It was like a gunfire or explosion, we were not sure of what happened.”

In what world is this okay? A family, with children in the car, fleeing the way you told them to flee, and your *moral army* shoots *everyone*???? And then *lets* an ambulance come there with VERY clear markings that it is one and shoots that too???

17s61yc,The 'Right of Return' has hampered the Palestinian cause,"Palestinians have been promised by their leaders that the resistance will not stop until the right of return for all refugees is granted. This is a cornerstone of their negotiating position. Never mind the fact that Palestinians are the only group in history where the refugee label includes all descendants, which makes the right of return a non-starter from the Israeli perspective. A 35-year old American doctor, born and raised in California, is considered a refugee if his Palestinian grandparent was one. No other refugee group is granted this broadening definition.

The belief in a full right of return was behind the Palestinians rejecting peace offers in 2000 and 2008. 

The Israeli offer in 2000 tried to address the right of return with this offer:

""In the Israeli proposal, a maximum of 100,000 refugees would be allowed to return to Israel on the basis of humanitarian considerations or family reunification. All other people classified as Palestinian refugees would be settled in their present place of inhabitance, the Palestinian state, or third-party countries. Israel would help fund their resettlement and absorption. An international fund of $30 billion would be set up, which Israel would help contribute to, along with other countries, that would register claims for compensation of property lost by Palestinian refugees and make payments within the limits of its resources""

It was rejected.

The other day I saw video of palestinian teenagers holding decades-old keys to houses/apartments that no longer even exist, proclaiming that 'these are the keys of our grandparents, and we will return!""

The longer the Palestinian people are duped into thinking a full right of return is possible, the longer we'll go without a Palestinian state.

Throughout history, those who lose wars (especially wars they start) must make compromises to start anew and move forward. Unfortunately for the Palestinian side, they refuse to make necessary compromises for a state to actually come to be.

When people talk about Palestinians, they replace their entire set of moral principles with a set of completely new principles, designed exclusively to demonize Israel and excuse Palestinian terrorism. Those principles go against international law, are never applied to any other conflict or situation, and would immediately be seen as absurd if anybody tried doing that. Under those principles:

1. Murdering civilians is a justified way of ""resisting"". Perceived oppression justified anything, regardless of international law or basic morality.
2. If you don't have a way of fighting ""legitimately"", you are allowed to commit war crimes.
3. Every civilian casualty is a war crime and an indication of genocide.
4. The relative casualty counts is what determines which side is justified. Intentions, goals, and the cost of **not** using force that may result in the death of civilians, are all meaningless. A person who mistakenly kills an innocent bystander in a self-defense scenario is more morally at fault than a person who attempts to commit a predetermined murder.

If those principles were applied universally, it would become obvious that we should support Al-Qaeda in its war against the US, ISIS in its war against the world, that we should've supported Imperial Japan in WW2, that the most ""moral"" path in any military confrontation is simply to surrender, that every military conflict is an act of genocide (among which, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the smallest genocided), that the US, NATO and Coalition forces were genociding Afghans, Iraqis and Syrians for the past 20 years, and many other bizarre conclusions.

The people making those arguments are either being intentionally disingenuous, are shallow individuals whose opinions are copy-pasted from bad arguments they've read online, without giving it any thought, or bad rationalization attempts by people who feel there is something that annoys them about Israel, but can't quite understand what exactly that is.

This without even going into the completely fictional, and chronologically reversed narrative, that the entirety of Palestinian ""resistance"" was caused by settlements, occupation, checkpoints, and the blockade of Gaza, when in reality Palestinian terrorism predates all of those, and the main act of ""oppression"" that organizations such as Hamas are fighting against, is the fact that Israel exists at all.",30/05/21 02:19:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/no1i7p/this_is_a_post_i_saw_elsewhere_i_want_to_put_here/,198,327,383,Israel,top,all
ho0fmu,Conceding some points to pro-Palestinians,"Since as we know, this subreddit is unfortunately saturated with pro-Israelis, which makes discussion too one-sided for my taste, us pro-Israelis should open up to discussions by proactively accepting pro-Palestinian talking points. Hopefully this will be more conducive to dialogue and help this subreddit be more interesting and balanced.

I'll start by setting an example of my own - here are some points I wholeheartedly agree with the pro-Palestinian side on:

Palestinians are suffering, badly. Many of them never took any political action, never attacked anybody, never objected to Jews living among or next to them. And many Palestinians are currently having an awful existence, between the corrupt PA which never held elections for over a decade, only pays terrorists and never supports their own people whom they don't represent whatsoever, and the Israeli IDF and checkpoints which often treat them with the utmost suspicion and disdain. The Palestinians did nothing to deserve that, and the I/P leaders have to reach a solution ASAP to address this condition they are living in.

Palestinian people have lived in Palestine for many generations. This is their homeland, this is the only place they can call home (apart from Palestinians abroad who managed to assimilate already). They're not foreign occupiers, they're not malicious thieves. Yes, they call themselves ""Arabs"", descendants of the Arab invaders to the Byzantine empire. Still, Arabs who came to the region did so over 1000 years ago. Are they not considered native at that point? For the crimes of their distant ancestors? Besides, many Palestinians are not ""purely"" Arab, they are descendants of Arabized locals. Yes, by that I mean some Palestinians are actually descendants of Jews and Christians, who might have converted to Christianity or Islam at some point in history. The Palestinian leadership may not be very fond of Jews and Christians, and many pro-Palestinians like to claim that the land is ""solely Arab and Muslim land"" - but genetically, some Palestinians really are descendants of Jews and Christians. Another reason why Israelis ""hating Palestinians for being different"" is stupid.

The situation in Gaza is a disastrous humanitarian crisis. The world needs to do something about it, and the best way to do so is to make sure Hamas doesn't receive weaponry. You don't want to perpetuate the fighting between Israel and Hamas, and give Israel more legitimate reasons to retaliate, do you? Hamas is still being supplied with weapons, ammunition and missiles, money for humanitarian aid is pocketed by Hamas leaders and never reaches the actual suffering people, even the UN is complicit in this continued abuse of the Palestinian people. Supplying the Palestinians with aid and electricity isn't enough - Israel needs to address the root of the problem and not keep perpetuating it, no matter how justified it momentarily is. I don't necessarily mean negotiations with Hamas, but ignoring the problem in Gaza won't make it go away. This issue must be solved posthaste.

If we are interested in a two state solution (which the majority of the world seems to view as the only viable solution to the conflict), then Israeli settlements are an obstacle to that cause. The big settlement blocs will not be relinquished by any Israeli leader at this point, which the Palestinian leadership has to take into consideration and accept appropriate land swaps - but the tiny, isolated settlements only necessitate wasting the IDF's precious time and resources. Yes, Jews used to live in the west bank before Jordan kicked them out in 1948, but if a two state solution is to be negotiated, settlers need to either not settle in isolated enclaves and demand that Israel recognize them, or agree that following a two state agreement, they will continue to live under Palestinian leadership, completely cut off from Israeli support.

Many of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions are desperate, ludicrous, outrageous, inexcusable. For the past several election cycles, especially since the allegations of corruption came up against him, he has been acting like a little bug desperately trying to wriggle out of a dangerous situation in any way he can, no matter what he knocks over in his path. Netanyahu only got 30% of the Israeli vote (that's less than Trump, lol) and he is a very divisive figure in Israel.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced in [1948](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_exodus), and they and their descendants have suffered greatly because of that. Most pro-Palestinians propose they should all get the right to return to the lands they fled, and that is indeed one option; if that's not possible however, for any practical reason, then Israel must at least address the awful things Palestinian refugees had to go through, for example with reparations, as much of their ordeal was the direct result of Israeli policies or actions (not all of it).

&#x200B;

Of course holding all these views doesn't detract from my pro-Israeli stance in the slightest. For example, I don't blame Israel and only Israel for most of the points I brought up. I think being humane and objecting to preventable human suffering is something we all can and should do.

Pro-Israelis are more than welcome to voice their own agreements with the other side in the comments. Pro-Palestinians, you're welcome to react to any of these points, or maybe even voice your own agreements with the other side.",09/07/20 09:58:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/ho0fmu/conceding_some_points_to_propalestinians/,201,188,888,Israel,top,all

19ammv1,You can be both Pro-Israeli and Pro-Palestinian,"Yes, everyone can be. Hear me out.

Pro-Israeli is not equal to being pro-Netanyahu, pro-Ben Gvir, pro-Smotrich, pro-war, or pro-settlements. Pro-Palestinian is not equal to being pro-Hamas or pro-terrorism.

These are just examples that people relate to when they say they can't be pro-Israeli/Palestinian. You can add to yourself more examples. Or at least try to find the light in a world you think is full of darkness. Understand that there is both good and evil on both sides.

For me...

Pro-Israeli just means that I wish good for the Israelis. For me, Pro-Palestinian just means that I wish good for the Palestinians. You can wish for both things without being bogged down by the ""how"" and ""but"" questions. You wish that both can live peacefully. The essence lies in creating an environment where both Israelis and Palestinians can coexist peacefully.

I hear so many times ""How can you be pro-Palestinian after what Hamas did"", and ""How can you be pro-Israeli after what Israel did"". Stop finding excuses. It's important to move beyond the blame game and excuses. There won't be good for Israelis without good for Palestinians. There won't be good for Palestinians without good for Israelis.

And don't start saying ""I can't wish them good because they don't wish for our good"". That's completely not true. Start by making the change! Always question the media you read. And the beliefs you were taught. For the best of everyone!

Remember, fostering understanding and empathy is key to breaking the cycle of conflict and promoting a future where both Israelis and Palestinians can coexist harmoniously. Embracing this mindset benefits everyone in the pursuit of lasting peace. Embrace the possibility of coexistence and work towards a shared future where both communities can thrive. It starts with a genuine desire for the good of all, unburdened by biases and preconceptions.",19/01/24 16:11:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/19ammv1/you_can_be_both_proisraeli_and_propalestinian/,194,367,308,Israel,top,all
1863zj6,"When you choose war and lose, you have to live with the consequences of defeat.","That’s what is missing in the Palestine debate.  
  
100% of Palestine would still be in Muslim hands if the Turks hadn’t chosen to side with the Germans in World War I. But they did. They tried to attack the Suez Canal from Palestine and failed. The British then counterattacked Palestine and succeeded. That’s how Britain (and later the UN) got jurisdiction over Palestine.  
  
50% of Palestine would now be a Palestinian state if the Arabs had accepted the UN Partition Plan. But they didn’t. They chose war and lost, badly. Then they refused to make peace. In ’67 they chose to mass troops on Israel’s borders and were again decisively defeated. That’s how the Palestinians ended up in their predicament. Their side keeps choosing war and losing.  
  
The notion that Israel is going to disappear is a Palestinian fairy tale. They need to set aside daydreams of a “right to return” to lands they lost on the battlefield decades ago.  
  
To those who say this is just “might makes right,” I remind you the Arabs chose the God of War to arbitrate their cause. They were perfectly willing to let military victory decide the issue when they thought they would win. But every time their armies are defeated they expect to reverse the verdict with an effusion of whining and terrorism. It doesn’t work that way.

1bwzgzs,IDF accepts full responsibility for killing World Central Kitchen aid workers,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXjLqfHljy0

Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, spokesperson for the Israeli military

The investigation found the WCK coordinated everything correctly with the IDF in advance. The finding of the investigations showed there were in fact a number of armed gunmen who boarded and left some of the vehicles that were identified during the course of the event. After some of the vehicles split from the others, the IDF which were tracking the vehicles which went south, did so thinking these were Hamas vehicles that Hamas gunmen had entered.

This operation of misidentification and misclassifications was the result of internal failures. This tragic mistakes should and could have been prevented. The strike on the aid vehicles is a grave mistake stemming from serious operational failures, mistaken classifications, misidentifications, errors in decision-making and strikes that were conducted in violation with standard operation procedures the IDF takes this incident with the utmost seriousness. We are still in the process of analyzing and implementing lessons learned from this event but the IDF will be implementing significant measures effective immediately. 

This is a tragedy, was a terrible chain of errors and it should never have happened. The IDF takes full responsibility of this regretable lost of lives.

https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-dismiss-two-officers-after-finding-mistakes-strike-aid-workers-2024-04-05/

IDF dismissed two officers (a colonel and a major) and formally reprimanded senior commanders including a general after an inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers. The case was also handed over to the military advocate general to consider a possible criminal investigation. 

Armed suspects had climbed onto at least one of the trucks. The IDF showed reporters drone footage of a man on top of a lorry firing a rifle, which a apokesperson said had prompted the military to try, unsuccessfully to contact WCK coordinators.

After the convoy reached a warehouse and the trucks were unloaded, the three WCK vehicles left the location and turned south down the coast road. It was 11pm, the IDF commanders could not see their identifying logos in the dark and did not identify them as belonging to WCK. The IDF had acted on the mistaken belief that the vehicles had been seized by Hamas fighters.

As the cars departed the warehouse, one of the men getting into the vehicles had been carrying a bag which the operators watching drone footage took to be a rifle. The stare of mind at that time was the humanitarian mission had ended and that they were tracking Hamas vehicles with one suspected gunman, at least one suspected gunman, that they misidentified to be inside one of the three cars.

Those strikes were in breach of IDF standard operating procedures.

1bokgpy,When can we stop pretending that Arab violence on Jews only started in 1948?,"There has been violence towards Jews in the Middle East and North Africa for centuries, but let's just focus on the ones in the British Mandate of Palestine.            

My hope with this post is that people will stop using the establishment of Israel and its actions as a country to explain away Arab/Palestinian violence towards Jews, as this was an existing problem far before the modern state of Israel was even an idea.              

The events of October 7th are nothing new, this has been going on for a long time.         

[1517 Safed attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1517_Safed_attacks): ""Many Jews were reportedly killed, while others were wounded or had their property pillaged. According to Garson, the Jews were **""evicted from their homes, robbed and plundered, and they fled naked to the villages without any provisions.""**\[11\] Many subsequently fled the city,\[12\] but the community was soon rehabilitated with the financial help of Egyptian Jewry.\[13\]"" 

  
[1660 destruction of Safed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1660_destruction_of_Safed): The towns of Safed and nearby Tiberias, with **substantial Jewish communities, were destroyed in the turmoil.**\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]\[6\]\[7\] Only a few of the former residents of Safed returned to the town after the destruction.                                       

[Battle of Hebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hebron): The Battle of Hebron and 1834 Hebron massacre occurred in early August 1834,\[1\] when the forces of Ibrahim Pasha launched an assault against Hebron to crush the last pocket of significant resistance in Palestine during the Peasants' revolt in Palestine. Although the Jews had not participated in the uprising and despite Ibrahim Pasha's assurances that the Jewish quarter would be left unharmed, Hebronite Jews were attacked.\[4\]\[5\] **A total of 12 Jews were killed.** The Jews of Hebron later referred to the events as a Yagma el Gabireh (""great destruction"").\[6\]\[7\]                               

[1838 Druze attack on Safed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1838_Druze_attack_on_Safed): The 1838 Druze attack on Safed began on July 5, 1838, during the Druze revolt against the rule of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt. Tensions had mounted as the Druze captured an Egyptian garrison outside of Safed.\[1\] **The Druze rebels and a Muslim mob descended on the Jewish quarter of Safed** and, in scenes reminiscent of the Safed plunder four years earlier, spent **three days attacking Jews, plundering their homes and desecrating their synagogues**.\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]                         

[1929 Palestine riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots) (this is more two-way than the other events but still worth noting):   

Events of 5689 Anno Mundi), was a series of demonstrations and riots in late August 1929 in which a longstanding dispute between Palestinian Arabs and Jews over access to the Western Wall in Jerusalem escalated into violence.  
The riots took the form, **for the most part, of attacks by Arabs on Jews accompanied by destruction of Jewish property**. During the week of riots, from 23 to 29 August, 133 Jews were killed by Arabs, and 339 Jews were injured, most of whom were unarmed.\[1\]\[2\] There were 116 Arabs killed and at least 232 wounded, mostly by the Mandate police suppressing the riots. Around 20 Arabs were killed by Jewish attackers and indiscriminate British gunfire.\[3\]\[4\] After the riots, 174 Arabs and 109 Jews were charged with murder or attempted murder; around 40% of Arabs and 3% of Jews were subsequently convicted. During the riots, 17 Jewish communities were evacuated.\[5\]                            

[1938 Tiberias massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Tiberias_massacre):   The Tiberias massacre took place on 2 October 1938, during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Tiberias, then located in the British Mandate of Palestine and today is located in the State of Israel.\[2\] After infiltrating the Jewish Kiryat Shmuel neighbourhood, **Arab rioters killed 19 Jews in Tiberias, 11 of whom were children**.\[1\] During the massacre, 70 armed Arabs set fire to Jewish homes and the local synagogue. **In one house a mother and her five children were killed**. The old beadle in the synagogue was stabbed to death, and another **family of 4 was killed**. At the time of the attack there were only 15 Jewish guards in the neighborhood of over 2,000 people. The coast of the Sea of Galilee remained unguarded, for it was the least expected direction for an attack. Two Jewish guards were killed in the attack.\[3\]

17ocajv,People don’t know what Zionism means and it’s ruining like 95% of the discourse,"People don’t know what Zionism is and that’s really scary. And yes the meaning of this word is incredibly important

I see a lot of people claiming to be antizionist while not being antisemitic and I don’t think people understand what antizionism means at all.


The contemporary definition ever since the creation of Israel in 1948: “the preservation of the existence of the Jewish state”

That’s it, if you think Israel should be on a map and then you are a Zionist


The contemporary definition of anti-Zionism ever since the creation of Israel in 1948 is the negation of the definition of Zionism which would be “the end of the existence of the Jewish state”

If you think something should happen that dissolves the state of Israel then you are an anti-Zionist

That’s the extent of the word “Zionism” it has nothing to do with the settlements or with the executive office. And yes I’m aware that settlers are Zionists, but guess what,  the Palestinian-Israeli citizens that had to flee Hamas and were taken in and naturalized by Israel are also Zionists. The Druze, and the Christians, the secular people, and the Muslims in Israel, all are Zionists (with the obvious exceptions of radical anarchist individuals in every society)


Even the ADL knows anti-Zionism has been bastardized into a antisemitic dogwhistle and is now being used by people who simply oppose Netanyahu unaware of the word’s definition. If you’ve wondered why you’ve been called antisemitic for calling yourself antizionist, thinking it means “I oppose Israel’s military, but I still think Israel should exist” then you are in fact a Zionist, WHICH ISNT A BAD THING! You’ve just been gaslit or misinformed into thinking Zionism = Jews-when-they’re-bad


This is the most important takeaway from 
From the ADL: “Anti-Zionism is distinct from criticism of the policies or actions of the government of Israel, or critiques of specific policies of the pre-state Zionist movement, in that it attacks the foundational legitimacy of Jewish statehood.”




Zionism = \ = pro-settlements

Zionism = \ = pro-Netanyahu

Zionism = pro-Jews



Anti-Zionism = pro-Hamas

Anti-Zionism = pro-Jewish diaspora

Anti-Zionism = anti-Jew


If anyone is wondering, I am a progressive, and I’m making this post *because* I see so many misled progressives and leftists siding with Hamas, putting antizionist in their bios without understanding how horrible it is, calling for federal aid TO Hamas, tearing down hostage posters in the name of antizionism when these same people would’ve killed to punch a Nazi in the face just a couple years ago. We need to do better

1ayc7n3,How Vox deceives viewers about Gaza & Israel,"Vox’s [“Gaza, Explained”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv1SpwwJEW8&t=2s&ab_channel=Vox) looks like journalism, but it's more of a master class in how to mislead viewers. It's gotten over 3 million views.

I've spent time in Israel, in Gaza, and worked for a major news outlet most of my life. Their video is presented as a balanced perspective, but wildly skews anti-Israel. Had they called it, ""The Gazan perspective ..."" I would've given it a Like and moved on.

Instead, I published this video in response, which dissects their approach, mostly by omitting critical information. 

While it was produced as a response to Vox, I’ve seen this type of bias well beyond them. I found it particularly troublesome with Vox, because so many people see their highly produced, non-hyper presentation as evidence that they’re providing balanced news.

*Like most bad journalism today, their primary sin is to create the narrative they desire*, then omit any facts that dispute that narrative. For Vox, the message was clear:  Through an unjust occupation and harsh blockade, the blame for October 7th and the entire war lies with Israel.”

To accomplish that, they first stacked the deck with 3 Palestinian voices, and the only Jewish perspective was the defense minister essentially saying he was going to blow Hama, et al, to smithereens. That was followed with a Palestinian-friendly view of the region’s history.

**“Occupation”:**  This was used as though it was true up to October 6, despite Israel’s pullback. They do that, essentially, by changing the definition of the word, essentially saying that the Israeli blockade = “occupation.”
**
“Blockade”:**  This is even more insidious in that they, and most other Israeli critics, completely ignore both, 1) the security reasons for the blockade, and 2) Egypt.  Vox pretends – and many people believe – that the “Israeli blockade” was something borne of hate and collective punishment against Gaza.

**“Hamas”:** I end up by looking at how both Vox, and others, completely ignore the reality of Hamas. The organization is well beyond both a “militant group” and even a “terrorist organization” … but instead is (or was), the functioning government of Gaza, pledged to destroy its neighbor.

There’s more in the video, [which you can find here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EWmp4cgznc).

I hope it’s both an insight into media bias and a conversation starter.

1avvlev,"In a first acknowledgement of significant losses, Hamas official says 6,000 fighters dead in Gaza","Link to source quoting Hamas official and analyzing situation:

* https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-six-week-drive-hit-hamas-rafah-scale-back-war-2024-02-19/

If for some reason you find it paywalled, here's a non-paywalled article with the Hamas official's quotes on the numbers:

* https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-first-acknowledgement-of-significant-losses-hamas-official-says-some-6000-operatives-killed-in-gaza-fighting/

It should be noted that Hamas' publicly stated death toll of their soldiers is approximately half the number that Israeli intelligence claims its killed, while previously reported US intelligence is in between the two figures and believes Israel has killed around 9,000 Hamas operatives. US and Israeli intelligence both also report that in addition to the Hamas dead, thousands of other soldiers have been wounded, although they disagree on the severity of these wounds with Israeli intelligence believing most will not return to the battlefield while American intel suggests many eventually will. Hamas are widely reported to have had 25,000-30,000 fighters at the start of the war.

Another interesting point from the Reuters piece is that Israeli military chiefs and intelligence believe that an invasion of Rafah would mean 6-8 more weeks in total of full scale military operations, after which Hamas would be decimated to the point where they could shift to a lower intensity phase of targeted airstrikes and special forces operations that weed out fighters that slipped through the cracks or are trying to cobble together control in areas the Israeli army has since cleared in the North.

How do you think this information should shape Israeli's response and next steps? Should they look to move in on Rafah, take out as much of what's left of Hamas as possible and move to targeted airstrikes and Mossad ops to take out remaining fighters on a smaller scale? Should they be wary of international pressure building against a strike on Rafah considering it is the last remaining stronghold in the South and where the majority of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip have gathered, perhaps moving to surgical strikes and special ops against key threats from here without a full invasion? Or should they see this as enough damage done to Hamas in general and move for a ceasefire?

191p082,Radicalism is also an Israeli issue,"Pro-Israelis are always quick to point out how “radical” and “hateful” Palestinians are, but conveniently ignore that thousands of Israelis exhibit these behaviours. 

Many Israel supporters on this sub justified Mia Schem’s comments that “there are no innocent civilians in Gaza” due to the trauma she has experienced. See https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/s/dEZnheMdBi

By that logic, what do you expect Gazans (half of which are children) in Gaza to feel/say given their situation? Not just post Oct 7, but also the decades of living in extremely impoverished conditions which Israel (and Hamas) has largely contributed to. 

Failing to see why Palestinians become radicalised, given their long-term living conditions and legitimate grievances, showcases a remarkable lack of empathy.

Palestinians, like everyone else including Israelis, are not hateful by default. For example, many Palestinians living in the West Bank have their lives disrupted (huge understatement) on a daily basis by approximately 700,000 illegal settlers who are protected by Israeli institutions. Those Palestinians are bound by Israeli military law and are routinely murdered by settlers who face minimal consequences. They are also often imprisoned with no charges or trial. 

While I personally think that Hamas is an obstacle to peace and provides no benefit to the Palestinian cause, Israeli policy and institutionalised discrimination against Palestinians is also a major factor. Let’s not forget that allowing Hamas to grow has been a long term Likud strategy to undermine the PA. Ultimately, Israeli policy is completely against Palestinian self -determination. 

Even if Hamas is “eradicated”, you still have the issue of illegal settlements inhabited by thousands of religious extremists on the Israeli side.

173tqwh,Hamas Could've Had a Real Win On Saturday,"Hamas had the chance to win on every front - including the moral and ""public relations"" fronts. They could've just not hurt, kidnap, rape, and murder any civilians. They could've just fought against soldiers, takw control of military bases. If they didn't lay a finger on any civilian, Israel wouldn't be able to attack back this hard, and would have had to agree to release terrorists in exchange for kidnapped soldiers.

Hamas could've walked out of this so good. But it's not them, and it's not what the Palestinian people, apparently, look for. Their cheering for the terrorists who came back betrays it all. 

If they weren't beasts, they could have actually won. But then again, in that case we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.",09/10/23 14:50:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/173tqwh/hamas_couldve_had_a_real_win_on_saturday/,193,110,129,Israel,top,all

Please, for the love of God try to acknowledge the opposing perspectives.

q7k01r,Mohamed Hadid (father of Bella and Gigi) straight up lies about his history,"This is from his instagram

>Thats how we became refugees to Syria and we lost our home in Safad to a Jewish family that we sheltered when they were refugees from Poland on the ship that was sailing from country to country and no one would take them... they were our guest for 2 years till they made us refugees and they kicked us out of our own home. 

Sad story, isn't it? Only a few problems with it. 

First and foremost being that he is from Nazareth and not Safed. Of course he couldn't claim that it happened in Nazareth, because it's still an Arab city to this day, and there was no expulsion from there. Indeed, he was born 4 months after the battle for Nazareth when it already surrendered and became part of Israel. 

Secondly, Jewish refugees from Europe didn't wander in the land searching for a place to live. They were all settled by the Jewish agency. Even if they weren't, they wouldn't go to some Arab's house when there are hundreds of thousands of Jews living in the British mandate. This ties to the false narrative that Jews suddenly appeared after WW2 in an Arab Palestinian state which took them in, while the reality is that there was no Arab Palestinian state and Tel Aviv, a city founded by Jews, already had a population of 120,000 by 1936.",13/10/21 20:32:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/q7k01r/mohamed_hadid_father_of_bella_and_gigi_straight/,193,186,233,Israel,top,all

1bvkgtm,No shame for speaking up for Palestine ,"This is basically a rant. I've been interested in this conflict for many years, having personally met both Palestinians and Israelis, and to be honest, it saddens me to see how easily people who openly support Palestine get bashed. I do, and I'm not stupid or brainwashed. I hate Hamas, I'm disgusted by the October 7th attack and by all the antisemitism, but I also know that not all Palestinians are Hamas and that they deserve to live with dignity and peace. Some might sympathize, but that's just the same as the Israelis that support the occupation and indiscriminate killing of Palestinians. And no, they're not just ""a few"". Don't tell me everyone in Palestine is a potential Hamas militant if you won't say that every Israeli is a potential settler. I don't think either of those are true, but people seem to very confidently decide when a generalization is acceptable. Questionable practices are taking place in both cases. There's trash on both sides, period. But we all know how evil Hamas is, their behaviour is admittedly not surprising. But Israel's is, because it's supposed to be a decent democratic country. Are we seriously going to justify everything it's doing when countless states and institutions are openly telling Israel to chill? We're not stupid.

In many occasions, any attempt to speak up for the rights of innocent Palestinians is seen as an attack to Israelis/Jews. I don't get it. Learn to differentiate. One person can have different opinions on the different aspects of the conflict, one opinion doesn't define the other ones. I don't get why many people fail to acknowledge that Palestine is not Hamas and that Israel is so clearly violating human rights. With Israel's actions, killing so many civilians, reporters and aid workers, the country has lost the little respect I had left for it. Too many ""whoopsies"" for a military that brags about its capabilities. ""But that happens in every war!"" So when I'm mugged at night I can't call it out because, you know, people get mugged all the time? 

It's like saying something in favour of Palestine automatically makes you antisemitic or a brainwashed little leftist. No, I'm not buying it.

njhc0w,Israeli protests against Netanyahu,"Hundreds of Israelis are protesting demanding the resignation of Israel’s current prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli press has said that Israelis were protesting on Balfour’s street near Netanyahu’s headquarters, blaming him for dragging Israel into an operation against Gaza for personal goals. 

Protesters say that the reason behind Netanyahu’s Attack on Gaza was for his own desires to suppress the creation of a coalition government with the leaders of the Yish Ated and the New Right parties.

Along with these events, A former Israeli Air Force pilot, Yonatan Shapira, Has described the Israeli government and army as ""terrorist organisations"" run by ""war criminals."" In an interview with an Israeli News agency this last week.

Captain Shapira who had resigned from the Israeli army in 2003 at the height of the Palestinian Second Intifada explained in an exclusive interview with Anadolu News Agency why he realized after joining the army that he was ""part of a terrorist organisation"". 

“I realised during the Second Intifada what the Israeli Air Force and Israeli military are doing are war crimes, terrorising a population of millions of Palestinians. When I realised that, I decided to not just leave but to organise other pilots that will publicly refuse to take part in these crimes,” He said. ""As a child in Israel, you are being brought up in very strong Zionist militaristic education. You don't know almost anything about Palestine, you don't know about the 1948 Nakba, you don't know about ongoing oppression,"" Shapira said.

orrjzl,Why Israelis are wary of pro-Palestine activists,"Okay, I'd like to address a few reasons why Israelis remain wary of western pro-Palestine activists.

&#x200B;

* **Not acknowledging Israeli Jews deep ties to the land of Judea/ Palestine/ Israel (whatever you choose to call it).**  Lots of activists tend to smear Israeli Jews as ""white settler-colonists,"" which does suggest that it is okay to expel them from Israel.  I've gotten into arguments with pro-Palestinian activists who think that the Jews should have been given a homeland in Europe after WWII rather than splitting the British mandate into two nations among other gems.  This fails to acknowledge the historical roots of the Jewish people in the country and the Jewish people's deep connection with the land.  Things like the Temple and Jerusalem mean something to the Jewish people.  Acknowledging such a thing doesn't mean that the Palestinians don't also have a right to a state but that both should equally be there.

&#x200B;

* **Not understanding why Jews are wary of living in a state where they are the minority.**  The Jewish people have spent most of their history in states where they were a minority group.  Saying it didn't work out well for them is an understatement.  If your solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict is that there should be one state with equal rights and free and fair elections, you have to understand why your average Israeli Jew isn't wild about the prospect of being in a country where they are a minority because of thousands of years of historical precedent.  Now, there are ways to frame a ""one-state solution"" that would address these concerns like a ""confederacy"" or some of the set-ups similar to other ethnic conflicts like Bosnia.  I don't particularly think this is practical but it is theoretically possible.  However, most ""one-state"" type solutions I've heard don't address those sorts of complexities and are just ""let's have elections now"" without negotiations.

&#x200B;

* **Dismissal of extremism among the Palestinians.**  I don't particularly care who is responsible for Hamas.  I do care that Hamas would do extremely well in elections in a single Palestine - Israel state.  This point has to be addressed for those advocating for elections.  Is Hamas banned from running in elections?  How does that work exactly if the most popular political party among the Palestinians is barred from elections?

&#x200B;

* **Willingness to accept Palestinian propaganda without verification.**  I think that a good example of this is l'affair de vaccines in June.  It was pretty clear to me that the PA backed down because of political pressure from the Palestinian street and used a nonsense excuse.  To think that the vaccines were defective or expired, you'd have to accept that the ""Peace Now"" crowd in Meretz was somehow involved in a plot to harm the Palestinians, that PM Bennett was okay with using the supposedly defective vaccines for Israeli teens including his own kids, and that South Korea was cool with accepting expired vaccines from Israel.  Yet, rather than question what happened, major human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch parrot the lies uncritically.

&#x200B;

* **Lumping all Israeli officials into the same category.**  I agree that some Israeli Jewish politicians are disgusting.  I hope that Lehava gets banned as the terrorist organization it is.  I'd like the nutsos in the Religious ~~Racist,~~  excuse me, Zionist Party, to be voted out of office.  But I don't think that a majority of Israeli politicians aren't part of the ""oppressive occupying force"" that is looking to ethnically cleanse Palestinian Arabs.  It's sort of silly and counterproductive to call Lapid, who has been in office for six weeks, a war criminal on some ethnic cleansing campaign.  Even Bennett, who has said some cringe-y and dumb things, has a much more complicated and pragmatic persona than he has let on in the past.",26/07/21 04:39:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/orrjzl/why_israelis_are_wary_of_propalestine_activists/,188,483,639,Israel,top,all
1843m5l,"Hamas is ""nice"" to hostages.","



All over social media people are showing the videos of Hamas and hostages waving to each other and saying goodbye etc:

One, in the video with the lady and little girl in the van, the Hamas dude audibly says ""keep waving"". 

Two, people are comparing these videos to two photos that supposedly show IDF arresting what looks to be two boys around age 10-14, with absolutely no context as to why they were being detained, to ""prove"" that Hamas are kind and humane and the IDF are the real terrorists. 

My question is this: Have any of you Palestine leaning people even considered the likelihood that they're under coercion to act this way? They are being told to wave as if to friends they're going to miss, while being released from captivity by masked ""militants"" carrying AK's. 

Have you even considered the fact that they might have been told to say favourable things to the media in exchange for the safety of other hostages, hostages they may even have gotten to know the past 50 days? In every video I've seen, the hostages look incredibly uncomfortable in my opinion , they look to be under duress. 

The idea that a video of waving ""proves"" terrorists who just committed a mass slaughter of civilians are actually kind and humane is insane to me. 

Also, do you think these people, who have just been through an extremely traumatic ordeal no matter how you think Hamas treated them, not being forced in front of cameras really means Israel is trying to cover up the fact that Hamas are actually sensitive, compassionate individuals?",26/11/23 05:33:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1843m5l/hamas_is_nice_to_hostages/,191,564,269,Israel,top,all
17nm4al,The ONLY logical thing to protest and pray for is the surrender of Hamas. Nothing else.,"The calls for ""peace"", for a ""ceasefire"", for a ""free Palestine""... howling in the wind.  Arguing, protesting, promoting any of those things is just stupid, a waste of oxygen, and a distraction from the only thing, truly, the ONLY thing that matters - the elimination of Hamas.

Israel WILL NOT stop.  There will be no ceasefire, there will be no safety for civilians, until Hamas is defeated.  At this point, I don't think even if Hamas freed all the remaining hostages that Israel would cease.  But I think we all know that Hamas will never do that, so it's an academic question.

16gp5bu,Why are pro Palestinian Americans so aggressive,"Yesterday I wore a shirt to school that said “Am Israel High” with a pic of snoop dog wearing a Star of David. Cute shirt. An Egyptian girl on campus literally snarled and asked me why I’m wearing an Israel shirt. She started mocking me and asking me what I’m trying to say. I told her it was an unproductive argument I wasn’t willing to engage in. I continually insisted I was not interested. She stood there looking like an idiot and started following me before finally walking away and saying, “Okay, Palestine shirt.” 

I’m an Ethiopian Jew and I’ve had this experience quite a few times with American arab immigrants. With no intention of approaching the situation diplomatically, they become nasty and angry. An old friend of mine told me I had blood on my hands after finding out I was going to Israel for vacation. Well what about your mother who’s tax dollars fund Israeli settlements. Is that how you change someone’s mind? It’s this exact behavior that keeps Israel strong. If you really believe in a free Palestine, you are by all means entitled to your own way of thought, but what are you actually doing to secure the future of a free Palestine if that’s what you want? 

I have no interest in entertaining this idea of a corrupt Israel, the whole world is corrupt, the United States even more corrupt than Israel. That’s why Americans getting aggressive about Israel is laughable to me. I don’t say this as a justification for the brutalization of Palestinians. But as a Jew, I’m willing to compromise my morals for the sake of Israel. I have spent a considerable amount of time there and I truly feel at home there. Unfortunately I have not had much interactions with those who identify with Palestine... I have no problem admitting that. If a solution exists for both Jews and Palestinians I would support that too, but I don’t see it in sight.",12/09/23 11:43:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/16gp5bu/why_are_pro_palestinian_americans_so_aggressive/,187,521,331,Israel,top,all
173m945,From Arab journalist Fred Maroun,"My latest blog in the Times of Israel: We were fools to support the Palestinian cause:

“We were fools. We were naïve fools. We did it carefully. We did it because we felt that it was the morally correct thing to do. We supported the Palestinian cause, or what we thought was the Palestinian cause: the struggle for a state of their own.

But any naivety, any delusion, has dissipated after the events of the last couple of days.

It’s not only that Hamas (which has been supported and nurtured by Palestinians and pro-Palestinian activists for decades) has engaged in a horrific mass murder of Israelis. It’s not only that this terrorist group is the most popular party among Palestinians and that most other parties are either just as bad or almost as bad. It’s also that the horrific actions of Hamas are by all accounts widely supported within the Palestinian community and the pro-Palestinian community abroad.

The supposedly moderate president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmood Abbas, refused to condemn the murders committed by Hamas.

The Daily Mail reported that after the news of the massacres of Israelis “there were cheers and triumphant flag-waving on the streets of Britain. On London’s Edgware Road, nicknamed the capital’s ‘Arab Street’, cars were draped with the Palestinian flag and horns blaring as if there was a football match victory”.

In Canada, a large pro-Palestinian union, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, tweeted, “Today, as Palestinians break down colonial barriers, they breathe life into the dream of an open, liberated geography”.

As Avi Benlolo wrote in Canada’s National Post, “the campaign to justify Hamas’ mass murder of innocent civilians is well underway”.

As an Arab, I am ashamed. As someone who supported the Palestinian cause, I am ashamed. But now, as far as I am concerned, the Palestinian cause is dead. In fact, that cause has never existed because all evidence points to the Palestinians wanting nothing but the destruction of Israel and the Jews, at any cost.

The Palestinians have had 75 years to choose to have a state next to Israel, but they have repeatedly chosen terrorism.

Through the murder of hundreds of Israelis and the cheering for those murders, they made their final choice clear. Some people will say that it’s the fault of terrorists and not the fault of Palestinians. I won’t be one of those people. Terrorists cannot exist unless they’re supported by the people.

Before this, there seemed to still be a glimmer of hope for a Palestinian state, but I now admit that those of us who believed in that hope were naive. That hope is dead now. I see many peace activists, who previously held nuanced views on the conflict, now declaring on social media their unwavering support for Israel.

What choice do we have left? The so-called Palestinian cause will now forever be covered with the blood of Israelis that Hamas massacred and that Palestinians and pro-Palestinian activists cheered.

The only hope left for Palestinians who don’t wish to be terrorists is to move out of Gaza and the West Bank. They will never have a state on that land.

In the meantime, each of us who pays any attention to this conflict must stand with Israel. It is the duty of every decent person in the world. It is the only reasonable choice left.”",09/10/23 07:54:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/173m945/from_arab_journalist_fred_maroun/,188,41,560,Israel,top,all
18rrgeh,Statistics Show That Israel Has Successfully Minimized Gazan Civilian Casualties,"A law school Dean published the below. Curious to know this sub's opinions. Any civilian casualty on either side is a regrettable tragedy in its own right but this statistical analysis seems to show that Israel has done a good job minimizing civilian casualties compared to other conflicts.

Set aside the unreliability of figures provided by Hamas--a terrorist organization that falsely accused Israel of killing 500 civilians with a rocket that was actually fired by Gazan militants. Even taken at face value, it is worth putting Hamas' figures in ""context"" (a favorite word of Israel's critics).

1. It's been reported that 67% of Gazans killed have been women and children. [https://abcnews.go.com/International/women-children-disproportionately-impacted-conflict-gaza-experts/story?id=104655493](https://abcnews.go.com/International/women-children-disproportionately-impacted-conflict-gaza-experts/story?id=104655493). But according to a 2022 UN report, in a typical war, 90% of casualties are civilians. [https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14904.doc.htm](https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14904.doc.htm). Israel is actually causing fewer civilian deaths than in the typical conflict, notwithstanding the dense urban environment.
2. Upwards of 5,500 Gazan casualties--nearly 1/3 the total--are reported to be children. [https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/22/israel/gaza-hostilities-take-horrific-toll-children](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/22/israel/gaza-hostilities-take-horrific-toll-children). What is not reported is how many of those ""children"" are boys 17 and under carrying automatic rifles, and thus legitimate enemy combatants. Plus, over 1/2 Gaza's population is under 18. [https://www.npr.org/2023/10/18/1206897328/half-of-gazas-population-is-under-18-heres-what-that-means-for-the-conflict](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/18/1206897328/half-of-gazas-population-is-under-18-heres-what-that-means-for-the-conflict). So fewer minors are dying than one would expect if Israel were indiscriminately killing civilians.
3. What civilians typically do to survive a war is...leave. In Ukraine, within a month of Russia's invasion, nearly 1/2 of the population had left their homes and 1/4 had left the country--some 14 million people. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian\_refugee\_crisis\_(2022%E2%80%93present)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_refugee_crisis_(2022%E2%80%93present)). But neighboring Arab states have refused to accept Palestinian refugees. They claim if they do, Israel might make Gazans' displacement permanent--a curious concern, given that Israel voluntarily left Gaza in 2005 and even forcibly evicted 9,000 Jewish residents. [https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/on-this-day-in-2005-israel-completes-disengagement-from-the-gaza-strip-679288](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/on-this-day-in-2005-israel-completes-disengagement-from-the-gaza-strip-679288). One would think a theoretical risk of displacement is better than a real risk of dying. Since Gazans can't or won't flee, the civilian death toll necessarily climbs, and Israel--not Hamas--continues to be blamed.
4. Responses to unprovoked attacks often cause more deaths than the attacks themselves. That doesn't make the response illegitimate. The 9/11 attacks killed 3,000 American civilians. ([https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties\_of\_the\_September\_11\_attacks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks)) In the Aghan war that followed, between 46,000 and 360,000 civilians died. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian\_casualties\_in\_the\_war\_in\_Afghanistan\_(2001%E2%80%932021)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_in_the_war_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%932021))).

The author concludes: The hatred of Israel is what's disproportionate, not Israel's response. No other nation would respond differently. Yet no other nation is as hated. Antisemitism, not body count, makes the difference.

Edit 1:

Users have identified 2 legitimate criticisms with point 1 of this line of reasoning.

**Criticism 1**

Point 1 assumes that the 33% of men in Gaza are all combatants. This is likely not true.

*- Mitigant 1:* point 1 also assumes that 67% of women and children are not combatants. Unfortunately, this is also likely not true. ""BetweenWafa Idris’s action in January 2002 and the end of May 2006, sixty-seven Palestinianwomen were counted as planning to carry out suicide attacks""

[https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Female-Suicide-Bombers-25-41.pdf](https://www.inss.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Female-Suicide-Bombers-25-41.pdf)

Mustafa Alkhair, commander of Hamas' Zeitun Battalion, revealed how the terror organisation uses their own kids to protect themselves amid the brutal war in Gaza.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8u-bjMAIh8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8u-bjMAIh8)

This is just 2 sources I found through a quick google search of Palestinian women and children combatants. Couldn't find anything on trans combatants, for obvious reasons.

*- Mitigant 2:* Hamas itself does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths in its reporting of casualties because it views its entire population as martyrs.

“ we are called a nation of martyrs, and we are proud to sacrifice many“ - Ghazi Hamad, Hamas Political Bureau

\- Mitigant 3: Between 10-30% of Hamas's and PIJ's own rockets land in Gaza. Hamas has fired thousands of rockets, meaning a material number of Hamas and PIJ rockets have likely landed on Gazan civilians (see Al-ahli hospital). So some gazan civilian deaths are likely caused by Hamas. 

[https://x.com/disclosetv/status/1719665588228751481?s=20](https://x.com/disclosetv/status/1719665588228751481?s=20)

**Criticism 2**

""But according to a 2022 UN report, in a typical war, 90% of casualties are civilians.""

The use of this 90% figure is misleading. The 90% figure actually says: ""Conflict continued to cause widespread civilian death last year, notably in densely populated areas, where civilians accounted for 90 per cent of the casualties when explosive weapons were used, compared to 10 per cent in other areas""

So this statistic measures what happened in 2021 when explosives were used in densely populated areas, which is what is happening in Israel right now.

*- Mitigant:* This statistic measures what happened in 2021 when explosives were used in densely populated areas, which is what is happening in Israel right now. So this criticism doesn't appear to be a death knell to the argument.

17fy2n4,I hate Pro palestinians,"Ok, I’ve been online for a while since this outbreak from hamas and it’s been disgusting for me as an Israeli. Now I don’t exactly hate all pro Palestinians, rather the hamas supporting ones that have the need to spam everywhere. Every instagram post, every tiktok post, every Twitter post full of Palestinian flags. You can’t start a debate with them either, they’ll call you a biased Zionist who only listens to western media while their news source is hamas who covered up that it was the jihadi who shot the hospital with their cheap rockets. Kids in Israeli schools(I go there) are taught peace while the schools in Gaza(there barely are any because hamas takes the money for humanitarian causes and uses them for rockets) are teaching kids to shoot any Jew they see. And all over social media people are standing by this? Or willfully ignoring it. Any video of a Jew I see is bombarded with Palestinian flags. That’s antisemetism at its finest. They don’t care about israel, they want the Jews dead. The protests, the boycotting. What is israel supposed to do about hamas attacking? Put down their guns and say “sure”? Then every Jew would be dead. But if they defend themselves in these times, it’s also evil? And boycott the products and companies that condemn hamas and support israel in these times. Wonder why israel has much more soldiers than hamas and the war is still going on? Because israel has morals. Hamas doesn’t, they dont even follow their own religions rules ffs. Hamas also, don’t forget endangers gazans by shooting from hospitals and civilian areas, and churches and mosques, knowing if israel tries to destroy hamas, they’ll have something to blame israel for. They use their kids as shields and they raise their kids to do the same.",25/10/23 06:01:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17fy2n4/i_hate_pro_palestinians/,187,1329,305,Israel,top,all
173xdar,"Saying ""Free Palestine"" Means Nothing.","I understand the sentiment, the injustice many Palestinians have faced, and the yearning for your homeland and of freedom from oppression that the proclamation represents. It's a call for the Israeli Occupation of the region to end. But probe a bit further, and very obvious issues start to arise.

When most people speak of Palestine, they envision a democracy, a country where they can be safe in, where they can have the same opportunities to thrive as others, a country that's theirs. Yet, they don't seem to quite grasp the situation - what will actually happen if Israel leaves. They have sunken so deeply into this idealistic version of what they view as their home they have become blind to who controls it. Because if Israel leaves, a democracy that's a safe haven to all Palestinians will not be what rises. 

Palestinians tend to forget that the people who will take charge are not a bunch of peace loving hippies, but people who will kill indiscriminately to reach their goal of an Islamic state. They are not fighting for your freedom, but for their ideology, an ideology most will agree is not the reality most want to live in. 

The organizations that the Palestinians often praise, that they defend, are a hurdle just as large, if not larger, than the Israeli occupation of the territory that will need to be overcome for what they truly want Palestine to be to be realized. But it is so much simpler to paint a black white picture, to put all the blame on one side, to shout ""Free Palestine"" than to think. To think of answer to the question - ""And if Israel leaves - then what?""",09/10/23 17:18:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/173xdar/saying_free_palestine_means_nothing/,182,128,284,Israel,top,all
1ap61cu,What has the pro-Palestine movement done to improve the situation for Palestinians?,"This will undoubtedly anger a lot of people, but I'm looking for a serious discussion here, though obviously I have my own biases. I'll preface this by saying that I support Palestinian self-determination. Like any other people, Palestinians deserve sovereignty and to live with safety, freedom, and dignity.

However, the pro-Palestine movement comes across to me as working against these goals by actively encouraging tactics that only make their situation worse.

Hamas' 10/7 attack on Israel sparked a full blown war that has left 10's of thousands of Palestinians dead. This was a very predictable outcome. Yet, the 10/7 massacre was instantly met with marches of support for the Palestinian cause with people holding up signs saying ""resistance by any means necessary"", rather than protests against the use of terrorist tactics knowing that they only endanger and put Palestinians in a worse position than they were in before.

Why does the movement encourage violent resistance when it has been shown time and time again not only to be ineffective, but to actively worsen the situation for Palestinians? It is well known that Palestinian terrorism is only met with tightened restrictions from Israel and brings them even farther from an end to this conflict. 

So why do people march in solidarity with violent resistance instead of propping up Palestinian politicians running on platforms of diplomatic negotiations towards peace? I've seen people use the argument that Hamas is the only resistance that they have, but I think that painting Hamas as a resistance movement who is trying to improve the situation for Palestinians is incredibly misinformed when every single thing they've done has only caused Palestinians to suffer even more. Not to mention that if you listen to what actual Hamas leaders say instead of speaking for them, they have said that the purpose of October 7 was to create a permanent state of war between Israel and Gaza, they vow to repeat October 7 until Israel is destroyed, and their ultimate goal is the establishment of a global caliphate. Again, I am specifically talking about Hamas, and not Palestinians as a whole.

I've seen pro-Palestinians defend and support the UNRWA, despite their hand in perpetuating this conflict by teaching antisemitism and martyrdom in their schools and refusing to work towards de-refugeeing the population.

BDS is far more mainstream than advocating to support Palestinian businesses. Even while a substantial number of Palestinians were relying on work visas in Israel for their livelihoods, the BDS movement still called to boycott the very same companies the Palestinians they're supposedly fighting for depended on to feed their families. And now all those visas have been revoked due to Hamas' actions.

I have never seen pro-Palestinians discuss the situation for Palestinians living outside of Palestine, including in Lebanon and Syria where they are arguably treated as second class citizens. Even when they rightfully bring up the racism Arab and black Israeli citizens face, they never fight to address and improve it.

I have never seen a single person at a pro-Palestine rally advocating for Hamas to release the hostages and unconditionally surrender, even though that would be the quickest way to end the war and prevent further loss of life.

I would support the pro-Palestine movement if I felt that it actually did something to improve Palestinians' lives, but in practice it just feels like an anti-Israel movement, even if it comes at the expense of the lives of the very Palestinians they claim to be fighting for.



EDIT 2: I also want to point out how this post makes no attempt to defend any of Israel's actions, but is rather about encouraging people to critically analyze the actual outcomes and effectiveness of the movement that is supposed to help Palestinians instead of just following it blindly. Given this context, some of these replies are very... interesting to say the least.",12/02/24 17:50:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ap61cu/what_has_the_propalestine_movement_done_to/,183,721,645,Israel,top,all
1bxq7mk,"Jewish Students, Are Feeling Threatened At Universities by Hostile Mobs Calling for Global Intifada","The highly aggressive, volatile demonstrations occurring at our educational institutions, are intimidating young Jewish students.  Many Jewish youth are feeling bullied, threatened and are saying that it is unsafe for Jews to attend universities like Rutgers. These incendiary demonstrations are creating an atmosphere of hostility that’s being perceived as being antisemitic by many. 

It's reminiscent to many Jews of darker times, when Jews were targeted and it became unsafe to be Jews, especially when assailants cover their faces and chant slogans, that some are interpreting as having genocidal undertones.

In the video taken at Rutgers below, pro Palestinian mobs are clearly saying 1) They don't want two states, they are calling for Israel to not exist ""we don’t want two states, we want 48"" 2) They are promoting  intifadas which are historically violent ""globalize intifada” and the ""only one solution"" phrase is being interpreted  by many Jews as a play off of words of ""final solution"" and this doesn’t seem to be a coincidence 3) They are supporting ""resistance” which is often used as a euphemism for terrorism.

By terrifying our young Jewish students, by making them feel unsafe, this should be regarded as something very serious,  alarming and even potentially dangerous. 

 The rhetoric being used by the Israel hating mob in the video linked below could arguably be classified as hate speech (By the ADL for example), and is being perceived as inciting violence. 

  Equating Zionism, which historically is an indigenous peoples’ rights movement with racism is dangerous and contributes to the othering of our Jewish youth at universities. 

  Anyone, who doesn’t condemn these clear calls for violence are complicit. We must stand up for the rights of the super minority class that are Jews, POC, one of the most persecuted and smallest minority groups. 

We should be very alarmed that White Supremacists are attending Pro Palestinian demonstrations and are finding common ground with those opposed to Israel’s existence.

We cannot allow ourselves to be bullied and intimidated by angry mobs. That hasn’t ended well for Jews in the past.

What do you think? Will you stand with Jews against hatred?

1b0hrip,I am pretty sure my friend stopped speaking me because of the current Israel-Palestine conflict.,"For context, I am Jewish and my close friend is Muslim. We have had numerous conversations regarding the overlap between our religions and the differences as well. He is someone whom I greatly respect and it seems at one point respected me. Several years ago we had a major disagreement on some of the events which had occurred in the Middle East. Admittedly, we both saw things more so from the side of our religion and we had an argument that left us not speaking for several months. Eventually after I apologized profusely he decided to start speaking to me again. This is an individual I asked to be a groomsman in my wedding so he is not a casual friend or an acquaintance. 

The reason I think that October 7th is the main reason he is no longer speaking to me is because his last message to me was at the very end of September and when I responded to him he never got back to me. It has now been nearly 5 months and I have reached out several times to make sure that he is okay but he has not gotten back to me. I know his phone is working because one time after I called him he called me back (perhaps accidentally) and then immediately hung up. 

I am posting this here because even though this conflict is polarizing and has people at odds, I think it is moments like this that require us to listen intently to people who we are close with even we do not agree politically, religiously, etc. I hope that you all have better experiences than I do and that this current geopolitical conflict do not change the way you interact with people. At the end of the day, I hope for the safe return of the Israeli hostages and hope that the civillians in Gaza as well as Israel remain as safe as possible.

18tnrpe,"""We don't have a problem with Jews, we have a problem with Zionists""","As an Arab Muslim, I'm primarily exposed to opinions from other Arabs and Muslims in my day-to-day life. One thing I often hear from them is ""we have no problems with Jews, we only have problems with Zionists."" Now I know some of them mean it, but others have said some pretty anti-Semitic stuff when they were in the privacy of their homes, so I know it's not the case that these communities overwhelmingly ""have no problems with Jews."" However, I always had a feeling that the split was closer to 40 percent (have no problems with Jews) to 60 percent (have some problems with Jews).

But a Pew Research poll from 2010 clearly highlighted how people living in Arab and Muslim-majority countries often have unfavorable opinions of Jews specifically. In terms of Arab/Muslim-majority countries surveyed, Palestinians and Jordanians were the most favorable but only 3% voiced a favorable opinion, followed by Lebanon and Egypt at 2%. For Muslims-majority, non-Arab countries, Nigeria was the most favorable at 44% (although only 27% amongst the Nigerian Muslims surveyed), followed by Indonesia at 10%, Turkey at 6% and Pakistan at 5%.

Just for the sake of comparison, people from these same countries said they had a lot or some confidence in Osama bin Laden at that time: Nigerian Muslims were the highest at 54%, followed by Palestine at 51%, Jordan at 28%, Indonesia at 24%, Egypt at 23%, Turkey at 3% and Lebanon at 2%. So, just 13 years ago, people surveyed from multiple Arab and/or Muslim-majority countries had, at best, equally favorable opinions of Osama bin Laden as they did of Jews and often had more favorable opinions of bin Laden than they did of Jews.

Now I know that most Arabs and Muslims are likely to respond with some version of: ""Well they probably mistakenly thought they were being asked for their opinions of Zionists."" However, even if we were to accept that as true, I think that highlights a serious problem within these communities, where the hatred of Israel is so severe that we have trouble separating Jews and Zionists.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the topic. How often have you heard this same sentiment when talking/reading about Israel-Palestine? When you do hear/read it, what's your typical thought process? Do you believe them? Do you think they're just trying to sound politically correct?",29/12/23 14:01:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18tnrpe/we_dont_have_a_problem_with_jews_we_have_a/,184,861,396,Israel,top,all
17at6cs,Even if Israel has the facts the people around the world has chosen a side Palestine.,"After all the misinformation that was running rampant around social media, it turns out that Israel didn't bomb the hospital(I believed they did aswell).

And it turned out to be a failed rocket from hamas within Gaza and it fell outside the hospital car park. We are yet confirm if the 500+ people dead are actual figures or are they exaggerated since a small rocket can't kill 500+ with the hospital still intact, Can some clarify it?

After all these information people still believe Israel did it. There are many posts on Instagram and tiktok that I have seen where people are claiming its done by Israel and 500+ people are dead. I feel like people have already made up their minds and won't change. Hence why I believe Israel lost the media war, Israel is seen at the bad guy in this conflict and literally have no support. Yes Israel has the western governments backing them but that's not going to last.

17j38la,Why are palestinians complaining about war now when they started it?,"It is my understanding that the 6 day war was started by Palestine and the other Arab countries against Israel for more land. And they lost, so please help me understand why Palestinians think it is unfair? When you start a war or battle you are also creating the unavoidable consequence that is murder and killing. The eyes of war is murder. 

How do Palestinians think Arabs even came to live in that area? It was through war and colonization! the Arab Palestinians are not the descendants of the philistines however the Israelis are the decents of the Hebrew people living there hundreds of years ago. 


As being Persian Iranian another nation the Arabs attempted to colonize I feel deeply about this topic. They were not fully successful in colonizing us so we were able to keep important parts of our culture. So I am saddened that the Jews were not able to keep their land and had to immigrate to Europe where they were also discriminated against. There is still only one Jewish state and there are 22 Arab countries. How does that make sense especially since the Jews are reclaiming stolen land?

18a01vq,“THE JEWS ARE COLONIZERS WHO STEAL LAND”,"
Curious...I ask you, do you believe that the right of conquest is legitimate?

If the answer is YES: Israel gains the territory in successive DEFENSIVE wars. 48, 67, 73...etc

If the answer is NO: then the land never belonged to the Romans, nor the Crusaders, nor the Ottomans, nor the British, all foreign occupying powers. The territory would belong to the Jews since the last time the territory was governed by an independent local entity was the Kingdom of Judea whose capital was Jerusalem. The name “Jews” is because we come from Judea. From then until 1948 there has never been self-determined sovereignty of a local power in the area.

PS: When has it been seen in 5,000 years of history since the departure of the Jews from Egypt that they seek to impose/spread their religion or culture on other peoples? Conquer territory or “evangelize?” How many countries or towns speak Hebrew as a result of “territorial expansion or conquests” of the Jewish people? Zero

Now ask yourself how many countries speak Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Dutch or Spanish? And how many countries did they impose their religion or ideology on?

nhgnls,"Anti-Zionism may not be Anti-Semitism, BUT","**Anti-Zionism may not be Anti-Semitism, but Anti-Zionism has an Anti-Semitism Problem.**

//footnotes are found at the end//

1. Anti-Semitism is surging in Western Europe in direct proportion to the situation in Israel and Gaza. Incidents of overt public Antisemitism have been occurring at predominantly leftist \[1\] pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist demonstrations. These demonstrations are ostensibly in support or solidarity with the Palestinian people and/or their liberation movements. In the past three weeks, dozens of anti-Semitic incidents and hate crimes have been reported all over Britain, France, Germany – almost all linked in some way with these demonstrations. That the anti-Zionism movements in Europe have an anti-Semitism problem is clear and factual. Anyone who denies this is wilfully blind to the grave reality of the situation.
2. Now I want to clear any possible confusions on the definitions and understandings of the terms Zionism and anti-Zionism. At its core, Zionism calls for the creation of a Jewish homeland and nation-state in the land of Zion/Palestine \[2\]. This would be a state governed by Jews, for Jews. There are secular and religious forms of Zionism, with the majority of people preferring to base their justifications on the latter. All else held equal, anti-Zionism simply refutes, rejects or criticises the very idea of a Jewish state.
3. I say it simply: Anti-Zionism is not inherently anti-Semitic. There are some qualities in its thinking which may be construed as anti-Semitic, but as an ideology it should not be taken to be anti-Semitic. This is all that I will say on the matter. I am not here to discuss whether or not Zionism is justified. Anti-Semitism is the topic of this article, not Zionism.
4. My concern lies in the fact that anti-Zionism in the West has an ugly tendency to collapse into classical anti-Semitism and does so on a regular basis \[4\]. There is clearly a systemic problem deeply ingrained within the anti-Zionist movement. More precisely however, it appears this problem mainly within the *active* anti-Zionist movement. A supplemental question should therefore be asked: what is it about active anti-Zionism that makes it specifically vulnerable to anti-Semitic possession?
5. In answering this let me first explain why I differentiate an active form of anti-Zionism. There are several factors that lead to a person harbouring active or passive anti-Zionist ideology. Passive anti-Zionists are likely people who, for reasons of religion/atheism, suspicion, or guilt, find that they cannot by any means necessary justify the creation of a Jewish state. What makes them *passive* anti-Zionists, however, is that they have no interest to pursue these ideological aims any further i.e., advocating/protesting for the reformation or dismantling of Israel.
6. Active anti-Zionists on the other hand have some form of internal motivation or drive that gives them the social and/or political willpower to organise and rally around the idea of dismantling the Jewish state. Where does this internal drive come from? By looking at some fundamental and shared characteristics of anti-Zionist activists, we can get a clearer understanding of their ideological impetus.
7. Perhaps the most important characteristic of anti-Zionist types is their pathological fixation with the state of Israel. Like moths to a flame, they have an ideological myopia that extends no further than the borders of the Jewish state.
8. Many anti-Zionists claim to be motivated out of love and solidarity for the Palestinian people and their cause. I have reservations that this is something which they seriously believe. This is because I think ‘anti-Zionism’ is semantically different from that of ‘pro-Palestinian’. Up to a certain degree of political commitment it is conceivable that a person may be pro-Palestinian yet not hold any notable anti-Zionist values (this is a position held by people who believe in a two-state solution for instance).
9. It is in our interest to understand the nature of this ‘tipping point’ where the person identifies first and foremost as anti-Zionist *and only then* as pro-Palestinian. How then, can a self-identified anti-Zionist claim to be motivated out of ‘love and solidarity’ for the Palestinians when this is a position held by people who identify *primarily* as pro-Palestinian.
10. It is clear then, that the anti-Zionist pathology goes far deeper than this initial claim of humanistic concern for Palestinians. We can discount any subsequent claims of alleged universal care or concern for human rights, because modern anti-Zionists hold beliefs which are excessively and disproportionately focused on Israel. As I mentioned earlier, this ‘ideological myopia’ really does stop with the borders of Israel. Literally. This so called ‘humanitarian concern’ seems to forget or ignore the hardships and constantly deteriorating conditions of Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. Concern for Palestinians living under the de-facto Fatah and Hamas regimes of the West Bank and Gaza is also somewhat muted, and only seems to pique when Israel is involved in some way. Anti-Zionist condemnation of Hamas’ roaming death squads (which terrorise Gazan citizens) and Fatah’s corruption (which further dispossesses those already at the bottom) seem to be oddly lacking. In fact, this lack of condemnation is symptomatic of the larger Pro-Palestinian movement. Nevertheless, it is clear anti-Zionists in the West hold a double standard toward Israel, and this cannot be explained by any claims of ‘humanistic concern’.
11. In my opinion, an explanation for these motivations can be found by looking at the inner workings of an anti-Zionist mind. At its core, the anti-Zionist mind operates with a varying degree of paranoia. This paranoia can manifest itself as a strong belief in conspiracies theories related in some way to Israel. These ostensibly anti-Israel conspiracies manifest themselves in extreme pathologies; of a world perniciously controlled and sabotaged by Israel; of a world in which there is a ‘Zionist plot’ to take over \[insert culturally relevant institution\]; of a world in which ‘diaspora Zionists’ are foreign agents who control the media and politicians. Perhaps what these conspiracies are trying to prove is that Israel has some supernatural kind of *power, control* or *influence* over the world. It follows then that these conspiracies find in Israel a special uniqueness, a peculiar quality that sets it apart in the world. Something which gives these paranoid minds a jolt... which wills them to action.
12. It is no surprise that this ‘something’ is revealed to be the *inalienable* and *inherent* Jewish connection with Israel. In my opinion this connection underpins almost all perceptions and engagement with Israel. Because of this anti-Zionist conspiracies have a hard time **not** falling prey to the allures of anti-Semitic tropes and canards.
13. On this note, it is worth noting that many anti-Zionist individuals do not become so out of any strongly held antipathy for Israel or Jews. Instead, they are socially conditioned to hold this anti-Israel value system. So, it is entirely possible for an individual to be raised to have an anti-Zionist value-system without necessarily harbouring any genuine anti-Israel or anti-Semitic motivations. This was how they were raised, and it is likely a deeply ingrained part of that person’s political identity.
14. I do not want to claim that ‘all anti-Zionists are anti-Semites’. Instead, I believe it is easier and far more defensible to argue that ‘all anti-Zionists are *at risk* of becoming anti-Semites’.
15. Therefore, I repeat my observation made in paragraph (4): anti-Zionism has a tendency to collapse into classical anti-Semitism. Anti-Zionist thinking is structured in such a way that it requires one to hold intrinsically anti-Semitic precepts (hear me out). It requires the person to say to themselves – consciously or not, ‘*I am actively going out of my way to preach support for the destruction of the Jewish state’.* On a subconscious level, this implicitly indicates holding a view of Jews which is ‘negatively’ correlated/associated with concepts of political power/influence. Do you see where the problem lies? This perceived ‘negative’ association between Jews and power contains the tiniest, most innocuous hints of anti-Semitic ideology. No matter how supposedly guarded-against-prejudice or anti-racist a person may be (as claimed by countless anti-Zionist leaders and campaigners), the likelihood of them acting on this anti-Semitic canard has become a non-zero probability. In other words, they have left the backdoor to their subconscious open to the prospect of anti-Semitic ideological possession.
16. As we have discussed this is a latent form of anti-Semitism. It is dormant... sleeping... docile. For the time being it is harmless. It is only when certain external conditions are met that this hibernating form of anti-Semitism begins to stir and awaken.
17. If our understanding of history is anything to go by, anti-Semitism seems to flare up in times of physical and psychological stress. Think political crisis, war, or large-scale economic collapse (as seen in Russia and Germany in the 1920s or 30s). Well, here we are in 2021, the ‘perfect storm’ with a massive pandemic, global economic downturn, and a violent political flare-up in Israel and Palestine. Any one of these could be stressful enough to make a person snap, but with all three...?
18. It follows then that with every iteration that the anti-Zionist has an encounter which reinforces their hatred of Israel or commitment to the ideology, they are not only strengthening but *feeding* the underlying anti-Semitic canards. Over time the anti-Zionist ideology has a new competitor to contend with. Fortunately, anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are in fact perfectly compatible and self-reinforcing. The critical-mass threshold is normally reached in group settings, when emotions are running high and the individual’s psyche is indulging in those feelings of visceral, primaeval disgust emanating from the unholy alliance between these two contemptible ideologies.
19. It therefore makes sense that the *entire* group (for instance at a rally or demonstration) will manifest this pent-up anti-Semitism in one, tremendous outpouring of hate. Think of it as a spontaneous form of energy release. Except this energy manifests itself pathologically in the form of verbal chants such as ‘*SCHEISSJUDEN*’ \[4\], or ‘*KHAYBAR KHAYBAR YA YAHUD’* \[5\]. This energy also manifests itself with the vandalism of Jewish stores, synagogues and graveyards \[6\]. In its most extreme form, this energy release results in violent assaults on Jews \[7\], and the burning of Israeli flags outside of Jewish schools or Synagogues \[8\].
20. To return to my original thesis; anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitic. That much is true, and indeed there are ‘true’ anti-Zionists out there who are able sustain their ideology without completely corrupting or radicalising themselves. But as I have also extensively explained, anti-Zionism holds certain values which manifest themselves to be outwardly conspiratorial and fundamentally based in anti-Semitism. It is therefore important that I re-iterate one final point; not all anti-Zionists are anti-Semites, but *all* anti-Zionists are *at risk* of becoming so. We as a society should take a step back and re-access the damage *already* caused in the past few weeks. The road down which we are currently headed will only lead to more misery. Take a step back.

\[1\]  I use ‘leftist’ contextually to describe the political stance which is critical of Israel and identifies itself to varying degrees with the Palestinian political movement.

\[2\]  Zion and Palestine have markedly similar references to the geographic area of Ottoman-era Palestine, which includes an area comprising modern-day Israel, West Jordan, and a section of Southern Lebanon.

\[3\]  I purposefully focus on anti-Zionism in the West. It should not be compared to the overtly anti-Semitic anti-Zionism found in Arab and Muslim countries.

nb6bc6,"My exhausted feelings, living in the Islamic world","I grew up in Los Angeles, with a fairly normal mixed Jewish and non-Jewish family. When I finished college, I moved to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and have spent the last seven years living alongside Iraqis, Syrians, Egyptians, and more as well as visiting Arab countries sometimes.

I get tired of visiting new towns, and nearly every town will have a ruined old synagogue that once belonged to a Jewish minority, of which zero survivors remain. Across millions of square kilometers, the ethnic cleansing of Jews has been implemented with startling totality. The shroud of silence on this issue sends a loud message to Jewish communities: their annihilation is tolerable.

If someone is okay with Jewish populations going toward 0% in the entire Middle East, but not okay with the Jewish population going from 10% to 80% in Israel as a direct result, then they are essentially wishing that there had been a decline in one place without any growth elsewhere: in other words, total death, or complete elimination from the Islamic world.

If they are criticizing Jewish construction in Israel, but unless they are out there in the hot sun helping building residences for Iraqi Jews, Yemeni Jews, etc to come back AND are guaranteeing it is safe enough to return AND are actively encouraging these Jews to live there instead, then they are wishing Jews would just die, pushed out from Israel to drown in the Mediterranean.

Ethnic cleansing is not what is happening in Israel, but if it were, we must answer the questions about the other 99% of the Arabsphere and Islamic world.

1an8co9,"Saying that Ashkenazi Jews originated in the Levant isn't justifying Zionism, it's stating reality","A substantial number of people on the internet kick, cry, and scream when someone provides any evidence that Ashkenazi Jews have plenty of ancestry that goes back to the Levant, and are largely Mediterranean in profile. This has been backed up by practically all reputable studies and the only ""argument"" that people with the opposite opinion have is ""WELL THEY LOOK WHITE"". That in itself doesn't say much, phenotype is subjective and can change due to things like founder effects. It's a deeply childish and unscientific way to determine origin. The science has been clear for a while about a Levantine origin for most of the world's Jewish populations, including Ashkenazim.

None of that has very much bearing on whether or not what Israel is doing right now is good or whether the Zionist project was a good idea to implement. You could simply be stating it as a matter of fact as opposed to justifying Zionism but people will not care. They need the white colonizer narrative to be real because they want to think they're fighting the French in Algeria or the Dutch in South Africa. 

It's also become fashionable for another reason-namely that there's the well-known meme of the white person in America claiming to be part native/Cherokee when they're not. They see Ashkenazi Jews as basically the Elizabeth Warrens of the Middle East. It's not surprising either that these ideas are being pushed almost entirely by people who live in the West.

Are there any non-Jews out there who disagree with and find themselves shocked by the rhetoric coming from far left?

I honestly just don’t get it. Like I acknowledge that it is awful that so many Palestinians are dying, and I don’t have problems with people being critical of Israel’s response. But there’s a difference between doing that, and what I see so many people doing - pretending like 10/7 wasn’t a big deal, and that Hamas are just freedom fighters or downplaying their role in all of this? Like people have this mentality that Israel is just killing Palestinians because of nothing more than their race which is just utterly rediculous. People treat this as if they’re rooting for a sports team - denying or ignoring anything that doesn’t agree with their narrative.

News flash, if it is hard for you to give an answer to the question, you support Islamic terrorism or you don’t know anything about the conflict. Period. 

As such, anyone having a “civil” conversation with a pro Palestine person should ask this question if the conversation gets heated, particularly when said person says Israel is committing genocide (a lie) or when they accuse Israel of being fascist (another lie). 

If you ask a palsbara the question as to whether they support Hamas and they give a roundabout answer, then it is likely they support Islamic terrorism and should no longer be engaged.

nij1a2,The situation in Sheikh Jarrah,"Correct me if i am wrong, but what I've found so far is the following:

Jews bought that land from the Ottoman Empire in the end of the 19th century, Legally. That was in order to protect a holy Jewish grave.

In the end of the 1940s Jordan forcefully evicted Jews that lived there, and Palestinians moved in instead of the Jews.

Two decades later Israel captured East Jerusalem, and that neighbourhood back.

Any Palestinians that legally owned houses prior to the capturing of east Jeruslame, were allowed to keep their houses and land, while in Sheikh Jarrah, 28 families have no records of owner ship, and were likely living in houses that were given by Jordan after evicting Jews. So they were offered to keep paying rent in order to live there.

If that's true, then why is there so much stuff going on around Sheikh Jarrah? Just because Jacob didn't know the history and thought that he was ""stealing""? maybe he just doesn't know?

If i have some information wrong, please correct me.

1av3nsx,"Some thoughts, as an israeli","This is just stuff I want to get off my chest. I can't say any of this online without an alt, let alone irl. Because I'm stuck in the center and all I see are extremists around me.

First of all, f*ck our government. This war is not being fought for our sake, and I'm sick of seeing people try to turn a blind eye to it with half baked excuses like ""bad luck"" or hypotheticals. I have my gripes with the way I've seen pro-palestine folks talk about us, and about our conflicts. But I agree with some of their points, and I don't think it should take much to at least question the way our government has been treating this war. At the end of the day whether you like it or not, there are innocent people living in Gaza. People are not born terrorists, and they have a right for a future like everyone else. Hamas is a terror organization, no matter how much people seem to want to paint them as freedom fighters it won't change the fact that this war started with a brutal Hamas attack. But, logically, I'm sure that a lot of the members started out with motivation to help their people first, I'm not trying to humanize them, they ARE human. No one starts out as pure evil, but with influence they sure can get there. And what have we been doing? Killing people, treating their deaths like they're an inevitable, isn't it obvious that those who survive those horrors will only be more likely to see us the same way??

Israel has the power to do this right. We have the iron dome, and we have a literal defence force. I'm sure that most of the backlash and stress being put on us from the outside wouldn't have come if we looked at the civil options that are available to us. Maybe its a tad optimistic, but I think a child in gaza would be less likely to take up a gun against us if we showed restraint after that attack. At least less likely than it is after their family and home was bombed to dust and ashes. Why is it so wrong to say that here (in israel)?

Of course, online it's a different story completely. You're either pro-palestine, or your views don't matter. Seeing people in the center get lynched for just saying that they want the best for both sides is beyond depressing. And I think the part that irks me the most is that 99% of the people who've made it their duty to fight for this cause are people who probably never even had to think about where to go if a rocket was shot at them. Outsiders get to have an opinion that isn't influenced by living through this. Palestinians and Israelis at least have an excuse to be extremists, god knows who they've lost or what they went through, outsiders don't. And it goes to both sides, even the terms pro-israel/palestine feel wrong in ways I can't put to words.

I'm not that in touch when it comes to politics, war tactics, and all that. So I'm sure you could nitpick my words and tell me why I'm wrong for suggesting this or that. I don't really care, I think my points came through.",20/02/24 00:24:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1av3nsx/some_thoughts_as_an_israeli/,171,380,561,Israel,top,all
17lacxm,NATO is justifying Israel and claims that Hamas is using human shields,"


Importent: while I still support everything I said here. I feel like I need to give another source. Here is a PDF document from the icrc about human shields:

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/irrc-872-bouchie-de-belle.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjAo9G47aOCAxU6W_EDHTpZD-sQFnoECBYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1yGnKLEQOtOoKh5Fr0rE5m

And here is a direct quote from the PDF:


""The obligation to verify that the objectives to be attacked are military
objectives
In the case of human shields, we have seen that a sufficiently significant military
advantage in relation to the danger to which human shields are exposed could
render an attack on a military objective legitimate despite their presence. It is
therefore all the more vital to be sure of the military nature of the objective, as
attacks on civilians and civilian property are categorically prohibited. The information
to be gathered in the course of this verification concerns not only the
nature of the target itself but also its environment. As we have seen, even in the
presence of a military objective, an attack can prove to be prohibited, for example
if far too many civilians are being used as human shields and would be endangered 
by the attack in relation to the size of the military advantage to be derived from it.
One particular difficulty is raised by ‘emerging targets’. In contrast with planned
operations, an ‘emerging target’ situation calls for an instant determination of the
military nature of the target and the conduct to be adopted if it is protected by
human shields. The commander is required to ‘do everything feasible’ to verify the
nature of the objective, as no one can be obliged to do the impossible.""


Many people have been acusing Israel for commiting war crimes, however, NATO has published a document that support Israel claims that Hamas is doing all it can to raise the death toll of innocent civilians while Israel is trying to avoid it.



The document even gives examples from 2006 until 2014 for when Hamas intentionaly tried to make Israel kill innocents while Israel did everything it can to avoid it.

15ojk15,Why I support Israel after previously having extremist views against it,"Hi all, I’ve been wanting to share my story for a while on why I support Israel after hating its very existence for so many years. 

So I’m going to start off by saying I’m part Slavic and part Middle Eastern (most of that being Arab and Amazigh) among other things. I’d also like to point out I have Sephardic Jewish ancestors but I wasn’t raised Jewish and didn’t know this until recently. I’ve always supported Palestine in my younger years simply because a Palestinian married into my family but through my teen years I hated Israel and even used the Israeli flag as a doormat for my room. I would post online one of the many alleged human rights violations to try to prove my side and would not listen to any other opinion. 

However, the more I would learn about the conflict the less sympathy I would have for Palestine. Starting in 1936, some Palestinian Arabs fired the very first shot during the Arab Revolt and in the 40’s, Mufti Amin Al-Husseini befriended Adolf Hitler and even partially contributed to the idea of The Holocaust. Because of tensions, the UN split the land and made Jerusalem an International Zone. Israel accepted the plan and declared independence as the only Jewish state and the very next day, Palestinians along with the Arab League tried to destroy Israel and lost. They tried again and again to destroy Israel and they lost. 

Now a days, they label Israel as a Colonial and Apartheid state and cry bloody murder online. The simply fact is, Jews aren’t Khazars but rather they are native to that land and it’s been proven by genetic studies such as ones by the NIH, Harvard University, 23andme and Ancestry DNA yet Palestinians along with Bigots and many Muslims continue to dehumanize Jews with this myth. Another reason I stopped supporting them is because of the lies they tell such as forced evictions and killings. Silwan is a good example, Silwan was Jewish owned until 1948 and it’s believed to be where King Solomon’s garden was. In the 80’s or 90’s Palestinians built illegal houses on the land even though photos show no one living there and it was a National Park yet they lie and cry Apartheid on social media. Most evictions are in East Jerusalem and happen because a Jew buys the house or the tenants don’t pay rent. Another one is killings such as in the Jenin operation about a month ago. The Media along with Palestinians alleged Israel murdered innocent children yet failed to show the photos of them in terrorist uniforms with weapons but rather shows them in normal clothes smiling to gain sympathy. Other allegations are from well fillings too but fail to mention they are illegal under Palestinian and Israeli law and get filled because they are in areas such as Nablus that have water shortage and such wells are dangerous to wildlife. Gaza is another example of lying where they claim it’s a prison yet videos like [this](https://youtu.be/wCuOHr3jMMk) show Gaza is rather nice and sure Israel will destroy a building but what they don’t tell you is that Israel only does so to target a terrorist and they actually warn before a strike but it’s Hamas that tells them to stay. 

Arabs serve in the Israeli government and Palestinians can enter Israel but not the opposite. Israel sends food, water and materials to Gaza and the West Bank daily which no one mentions and sure you can tell me about Lehi and Irgun who weren’t even part of Israel and actual problems like settler violence but it’s clear Israel didn’t do anything wrong and most criticisms by not just Palestinians but “Human Rights Groups” and the UN are refuted lies with no basis. People will criticize anything Israel does but never talk about modern slavery in the gulf, abuse of Christians in MENA or anything else like that. How come Jews don’t have the right of self determination or even the right to live in their land? This clearly shows dishonesty and a double-standard.

1basojw,Help me understand how Palestine became a victim,"I am a an Atheist from a Hindu background who was about to convert to Islam a month back.

I've never had any serious thoughts about islam until I saw a video by one of a famous youtuber Hamza Ahmed about why he started reading the Qur'an.

Being an atheist, I am currently handling an existential crisis with my career and love life and that was what made me slip into the thought of considering Islam might be the way forward for me.

Thankfully my inquisitive mind started researching Islam and I found many disturbing things about the origin of the religion ~~and I was able to relate almost 60 - 70% of all world problems to this religion one way or the other~~.

Now that's when I started researching about what's happening in Israel and Palestine.

I'm not able to understand how most of the Leftist world is supporting Palestine.

As of my understanding, Judaism is the oldest abrahamic religion and Jerusalem is its holy place from 10th century BC.

Christianity originated from around Jerusalem and Jesus was a Jew himself by birth.

So even the Bible proves that Jews lived around Jerusalem (the now land of Israel) since a long time than Christians and Muslims ever were.

Whereas Islam originated in Medina, Saudi and almost everyother place they are in now is mostly through conquest.

No really sure how the land of Palestine belongs to anyone other than Jews though.

So when jews were killed everywhere, they had to come back to their own land and form a country.

And since then everytime there was a war, the Palestinians started it.

Even when every single time Israelites offered peace - even by giving back the captured Gaza at one point.

Even now, it was the Hamas (Palestinians) who first attacked Israel.

Palestinians voted for Hamas.

They knew the ideology and the action plans of Hamas and still voted for them.

Hamas attacked Israel and raped and killed innocent citizens.

What's Israel supposed to do other than destroying Hamas and making sure Hamas doesn't message with them and ruin their peace all over again?

Why is Israel posed bad by most of the world for doing what it's supposed to do?

Am I missing something?

I listened to some of the Indian media who were against Palestine but I don't want the influence of hindutva - I'm aversive of that ideology as well.

Can you guys give me an unbiased view on why Palestine is posed as the victim by most of the world even though they were the ones who wants to kill and attacked Israel every single time?

Why can't they just co-exist and make peace?

What is it that I'm missing?

17tff41,"A perspective of a palestinian who lived in Israel for 30 years ( yes, we exist!)","I am an indigenous Palestinian who lived 30 years of my life in Israel. I don’t practice religion, I speak fluent Hebrew, I studied in an Israeli academy and I was surrounded by Israeli coworkers and friends. For me, life in Israel was a daily struggle. When I was young and extremely vulnerable I tried to assimilate in the Israeli society. I avoided talking about my identity, I worked hard on developing an israeli accent, I dressed and behaved similarly. But I was still “the hated other” no matter what I did. When I wasn’t accepted for the university dorms I tried to find an apartment to rent, two renters said straight to my face that they don’t rent to Arabs. I went shopping with my dad in a mall in the “cool and hype Tel Aviv” (Azrieli) when a store owner told me and my dad that we are not welcome in the store (there is really no context, he heard us speaking in Arabic and approached us).. it is very common for Israelis to say things like “you look like an Arab” to mock someone’s look or when a military personnel dies and just before IDF releases names, they would publicly wish he is an arab. Traveling with Israeli Jewish friends on multiple occasions , I was the only one who would be called for additional TSA checks where I had to take off my pants/shirt at the airport and that always required separating me and the group. Although i am a citizen of Israel , there are a lot of towns I cannot live in because I’m not Jewish. There are restaurants I can’t work for because I’m “Goya” meaning non Jewish. My uncle was shot and murdered a few years ago and the Israeli police didn’t investigate his murder and closed the case in two weeks although we pleaded for answers! 
 Basically, at some point I had some existential questions, like WTH! How would I combat this Jewish supremacists mentality? What else do I need to do to be seen as an equal? How does the west call this establishment a democracy?. And then I realized that there is nothing I could do. But there has been a huge shift and awakening within me, I learned about the Nakba, I’m now proud of my palestinians ancestors, I travel often to the West Bank and see some crazy levels of humiliations and racism against the Palestinians  whether Muslims or Christians, things that continue to shake me( checkpoints separating towns in the West Bank, home demolitions, child arrest, building illegal settlements on Palestinian lands) . Thankfully, I now live in a safer and more accepting place, when the amnesty report about Israel being an apartheid state was released I felt this huge sense of relief, I felt validated and seen.

Edited: some individuals are claiming I’m a troll and fake because they would rather think that over the fact that there is systematic racism against Palestinians in Israel. Israeli government has always tried to take away the credibility of our voices, suppress our narrative and marginalize us (the comment section is a reflection of that). I’m not welling to disclose personal details about myself because this isn’t a safe space. I don’t live in Israel any more, in the last paragraph I clearly say I now live in a safe and more accepting place.

1bq0s92,Gaza Fatality Data Has Become Completely Unreliable,"[Washington Institute of Near East Policy](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/gaza-fatality-data-has-become-completely-unreliable) analysis of how the 72% women and children figure is reached. This analays is shows that the Ministry of Health in Gaza (MoH) now relies on unverified, and unspecified media reports to collect the data. Previously the MoH collected data through it's collection system, often gathered from Hospitals and Morgues, but since the invasion began in the North, many of the hospitals and morgues were either evacuated or destroyed. 

The differences in demographic reporting that two methodologies have is stark. Where the traditional collection agency reports that 51% of the casualties are men, the media reports that only 8% are men. Where the collection agency reports 15% of the dead are children, the collection agency reports 63%. The two align closer when it comes to women dead, however.

The 70% women and children number is often cited and used by critics of Israel, including even the current US administration, without any critical thought as to how this number is achieved. 

While the war is terrible, and yes, 15% of the casualties being children is horrific, let's put it into the context of how this is framed: the argument here is that Israel deliberately kills civilians, especially women and children.

Of course, we also have to take into consideration that for the collection agency itself it's increasingly difficult for them to collect the data reliably as well. So the number, is not truly known.

But if the data is so unreliable why continue to use this demographic statistic as a point of criticism?",28/03/24 17:08:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bq0s92/gaza_fatality_data_has_become_completely/,173,366,258,Israel,top,all

1blu3k4,Genocide in Gaza?,"I don't understand why people label it as genocide when ISRAEL is CLEARLY avoiding unnecessary civilian casualties

Compare it to the UK during WW2.
12,000 tons of explosive force dropped on them by Germans which resulted in 30,000 pure civilian deaths even though THEY HAVE BOMB SHELTERS. 

While in Gaza, the total tons of explosive force dropped on them is 70,000 tons from the 30,000 explosive weapons dropped resulting in 30,000 deaths.

-they have no bomb shelters at all even though the leader of hamas is a billionare

-their soldiers are dressed up as civilians and even counted as a civilian casualty

-6000 to 10,000 of those 30,000 deaths are hamas soldiers casualties

Achieving a 1:1 casualty ratio for civilian to bomb (1 bomb per 1 civilian) is a very hard MILITARY FEAT to achieve. There's almost no other military feat similar to this

Which is made more difficult because:

-Hamas are dressed up as civilians in their live battle footage in gaza

-THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SINGLE BOMB SHELTER IN GAZA.


So how are the casualties in Gaza who has no bomb shelters and more bombs dropped similar to the casualties of UK in WW2 who has less bombs dropped on them but similar casualties?

There's no GENOCIDE in GAZA period. Israel is not ""carpet bombing"". It's HAMAS who is committing intentional genocide and ethnic cleansing while Israel avoids unnecessary civilian casualties.

Compare it to Oct. 7 where Hamas intentionally fired upon civilians and committing massacres everywhere near the border. That is REAL GENOCIDE and ETHNIC CLEANSING.
They're even videotaping their massacres and parading the naked dead body of a German girl named Shani Louk.

Things like the 1834 Safed massacre put a damper on that narrative, but there are fascinating accounts from travelers who mention the misery of the Jews under Muslim rule.

[Israel Joseph Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Benjamin), or J.J. Benjamin, was a Jewish traveler who visited Jewish communities around the world. He wrote repeatedly on the abuse of Jews at the hands of Muslims. Here is his account of his trip to Palestine in 1847:

>The State of the Jews in Palestine

>Deep misery and continual oppression are the right words to describe the condition of the Children of Israel in the land of their fathers. — 1 comprise a short and faithful picture of their actual state under the following heads.

>1) They are entirely destitute of every legal protection and every means of safety. Instead of the security afforded  the law, which is unknown in these countries, they are solely under the orders of the sheiks and pachas, men, whose character and feelings inspire but little confidence from the beginning, It is only the European Consuls who frequently take care of the oppressed, and give them some protection.

>2) With unheard of rapacity, tax upon tax is levied on them. With the exception of Jerusalem, every where the taxes demanded are arbitrary. Whole communities have been impoverished by the exorbitant claims of the sheiks, who, under the moat trifling pretenses, without any control, oppress the Jews with fresh burdens. It is impossible to enumerate all these oppressions.

>3) In the strict sense of the word they are not even masters of their own property. They do not even venture to complain when they are robbed and plundered; for. the vengeance of the Arabs would follow each complaint.

>4) Their lives are taken into as little consideration as their property; they are exposed to the caprice of any one; for even the smallest pretext, even a harmless discussion, a word dropped in conversation; is enough to cause bloody reprisals. Violence of every kind is of daily occurrence, When; for instance in the contests of Mahomet Ali with the Sublime Porte, the City of Hebron was besieged by Egyptian troops and taken by storm, the Jews where murdered and plundered, and the survivors scarcely even allowed to retain a few rags to cover them. No pen can describe the despair of these unfortunates. The women were treated with brutal cruelty; and even to this day, many are found who from that time became miserable cripples. With truth can the Lamentations of Jeremiah be employed here. Since that great misfortune up to the present day, the Jews of Hebron languish in the deepest misery, and the present Sheik is unwearied in his endeavours, not to better their condition, but on the contrary to make it worse.

>5) The chief evidence of their miserable condition is the universal poverty which we remarked in Palestine, and which is here truly characteristic; for nowhere else in our long journeys, in Europe, Asia and Africa did we observe it among the Jews. It even causes leprosy among the Jews of Palestine, as in former times. Robbed of their means of subsistence from the cultivation of the soil and trade, they only exist upon the charity of their brethren in the faith in foreign parts. The writer, who has seen all this misery with his own eyes, and with his hands has touched the deep and ever open bleeding wounds of his brethren, has often repeated the words of Jeremiah: ""If I go forth into the field, there behold the slain with the sword, and when I enter into the city then behold those who are sick with famine. How my heart is oppressed with sadness! How loudly it throbs that I can nowhere find peace."" But with all the misery which he grieves over, has he also admired the resignation with which his brethren in the faith have borne their misfortunes for hundreds of years up to this time, and the confidence, with which they continue to be steadfast in hope. Like shadows, they steal over the land, which nourishes their cruel and imperious tyrants. The ignorant and barbarous Arab tramples this sacred soil beneath his feat, and considers the Jew a disinherited and accursed being, unworthy of dwelling there; and yet these ruins, these desolate cities, these wide-spreading fields now uncultivated and laid waste, are the inheritance of Israel; and still does this fruitful land up to the present day bring forth abundantly every kind of grain, fruits of all countries, and excellent wine; and its air is also of exquisite purity and freshness.

>... In a word the state of the Jews in Palestine, body as well as mind, is an unbearable one; and yet there the land yields most abundantly. If the possession of it were not to completely in the hands of the Arabs, — if one could only secure for the Jews some little portion of it and give them the means for its cultivation - sufficient sources of industry would be open to them; wherewith to obtain a livelihood. But what does it benefit them to cultivate the ground, if the Arabs rob them of the harvest?

So please spare us this idea of Palestine being some idyllic model of coexistence. It was an impoverished backwater province of the Ottoman Empire where the local Arab population treated Jews the same way white southerners treated free blacks.",03/06/22 08:30:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/v3usz9/how_jews_in_palestine_actually_lived_before/,171,263,935,Israel,top,all
196jsi2,Antisemitism on the left causes an existential crisis for a life long leftie,"There are many things that have made me want to write about this, but this post that my 'friend' shared on instagram has sent me over the edge - [https://www.instagram.com/p/C1-VZJjP8ak/?fbclid=IwAR333YrlgcctIjjJ8x2pTADgXwtiMBlLkH1kpCwekX79kjKj5xhDqJzw1\_c](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1-VZJjP8ak/?fbclid=IwAR333YrlgcctIjjJ8x2pTADgXwtiMBlLkH1kpCwekX79kjKj5xhDqJzw1_c)  


Basically it criticises anti-zionist Jews in the movement for Palestinian liberation because they 'care about Jewish safety', 'believe resistance groups (the groups that openly call to wipe out jews) are terrorists' and 'believe their voices as Jewish people are important'. I find this post horrific, but have heard this echoed many times all across the movement.   


For context, I've been active in the radical left for 6 years, I identify as a Marxist and have been active in the pro-Palestine movement for just as long, I am friends with many Palestinians, and had never had much issue with anything they have said before 07/10, they all had disliked Hamas before, and were against them. They would say it's nothing to do with Jews, and they could stay there, but Zionism has to go. I have learnt in the last three months that this is not true.   
The world's, and specifically the left's, apathy for the rise in anti-Semitism has taught me a lot, in fact I'd say now that I understand Zionism better than ever. The left as it is right now is embarrassing, they pretend to be academic on TikTok and Instagram but they have absolutely no idea what their talking about. They see Jews as white people and are so ready to undermine any discrimination against them, and know nothing about the legitimate diversity of ethnicity in Israel and that this is nothing to do with race. I never believed that the side lining and purposeful anti-white rhetoric in activist spaces the last 4 years or so would have any serious repercussions (I mean I never found it offensive and did think perhaps white people needed to shut up and listen to POC), but the way this has materialised in excusing anti-Semitism, is just horrific to me.  


The Left has historically let the Jewish people down, sold them out, undermined their oppression, allowed pogroms and disposition. Just because they may not be in such unfortunate circumstances as the Palestinians, their history also too needs to be acknowledged. 'Friend's of mine now post 'they came in boats, they can leave in boats', and go where? I recently read a fantastic book about Jewish Resistance, I very much recommend for any pro-Jewish lefties out there! [https://www.amazon.com/Revolutionary-Yiddishland-History-Jewish-Radicalism/dp/1784786063](https://www.amazon.com/Revolutionary-Yiddishland-History-Jewish-Radicalism/dp/1784786063)   
In this book they interview communists, socialists, unionists, and ultimately, after the second world war, whilst they didn't believe in Zionism, antisemitism never left Europe, and they choose to go to Israel because they were done with being beaten in the streets, fired from their jobs, rejected from full citizenship. So again, I ask where do they go? Back to the places where there are Jewish businesses, Synagogues and people being attacked right now? Learning about the holocaust when I was 11 was one of the first experiences that turned me into the political person I am now, I would never turn my back on Jewish safety in the name of a popular movement with absolutely no consideration for it.

The final thing that made me want to write out my frustrations is now the people in the streets of London celebrating the Houthis. Whilst I think the war in Gaza should stop, sanctions should be put on Israel and Palestinians deserve reparations on a massive scale, we can't celebrate an organisation that are not only tyrants to their own people, but in their ***literal flag***  they call to curse the Jews. Not the Zionists, the Jews. HOW can people openly criticise pro-Palestinian anti-Zionist left wing Jews, that are organising protests, writing articles, releasing research, and working with Palestinians both in Israel and out of it, but be happy to uplift Houthis as leaders of resistance? With no questions asked! Believe me, I know the movement very well, and no one talks about the several shades of anti-Semitism that shadows over it more and more.   


This whole thing has been hard, people I know and trust both personally and politically have been sharing fake news continuously. They lie about Israel, they lie about Hamas, they deny 07/10 (say it was all the IDF), they lie about the history, and people eat it up instantly. It has made me doubt so much more about my Marxist education, which makes me feel uncomfortable, but there is no one out there that I trust, even Jeremy Corbyn who I love! I guess Owen Jones is the only guy making any sense, he speaks with Jewish and Palestinian activists and academics, other than that, everyone can f\*\*\* off. I'd love to speak about this further, and if you're a left wing Jew that has felt alienated the last 3 months, I'm with you, understand and am sorry. x

19czixd,The 10/7 Denialism and Historical Revisionism Has Begun In Force,"Today, [Hamas released a report](https://www.lbcgroup.tv/uploadImages/ExtImages/Images2/Our%20Narrative-Operation%20Al-Aqsa%20Flood-Web_compressed%20(1).pdf) on their 10/7 attack on Israel, specifically their ""narrative."" It is of course full of lies, both recent and historic, which you can review at your displeasure. Of particular interest is their description of the 10/7 attack itself.

>  Avoiding harm to civilians, especially children, women and elderly people is a religious and moral commitment by all the Al-Qassam Brigades’ fighters. We reiterate that the Palestinian resistance was fully disciplined and committed to the Islamic values during the operation and that the Palestinian fighters only targeted the occupation soldiers and those who carried weapons against our people. In the meantime, the Palestinian fighters were keen to avoid harming civilians despite the fact that the resistance does not possess precise weapons.

> Video clips taken on that day – Oct. 7 – along with the testimonies by Israelis themselves that were released later showed that the Al-Qassam Brigades’ fighters didn’t target civilians, and many Israelis were killed by the Israeli army and police due to their confusion.

And

> The suggestion that the Palestinian fighters committed rape against Israeli women was fully denied including by the Hamas Movement. A report by the Mondoweiss news website on Dec. 1, 2023, among others, said there is lack of any evidence of “mass rape” allegedly perpetrated by Hamas members on Oct. 7 and that Israel used such allegation “to fuel the genocide in Gaza.”

Hamas denies entirely that a) civilians were targeted and killed and b) that any Palestinians raped any women.

[The Washington Post reported yesterday that similar arguments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/21/hamas-attack-october-7-conspiracy-israel/?utm_source=alert) are going around the pro-Palestine movement in the West. 

> “Israel murdered their own people on October 7,” said Christina Gutierrez, an analyst in the city’s housing department, where some in the crowd shouted “antisemitism isn’t real.”

> The head of International Relations for Hamas, Basem Naim, has falsely asserted that the group “didn’t kill any civilians” when it attacked Israel on Oct. 7, calling the claim “Israeli propaganda.”

> “Despite how it can appear sometimes I don’t actually have an axe to grind with the Jews,” said Owen Benjamin, a comedian who embraces far-right and antisemitic content, in a November post on X. “It’s just the insane Holocaust narrative and fake war atrocities by shoved down our throats as Americans by israel needs constant pushback,” he wrote in apparent reference to the atrocities of Oct. 7.

10/7 occurred less than six months ago, and for a long time, the murder and killings of Israeli civilians were cheered and praised by the pro-Palestine movement. Now, perhaps as the heady joy dissipates, the realization that maybe it's not the greatest idea to cheer for murdered  and raped Jews is finally occurring to the anti-Israelis. 

But of course, Palestine and the pro-Palestinian movement are never wrong and never capable of making mistakes. There's no room for apologizing or introspection or making amends. No, instead, the entire history of 10/7 must be rewritten to exonerate Hamas for absolutely everything. Civilians certainly were not killed on 10/7. Women were definitely not raped. 

And of course, if you disagree with the Palestinian narrative, you know what you're going to be called. 

Numerous mainstream newspapers and media outlets have confirmed the deaths and rapes of Israeli civilians on 10/7. There are numerous websites in which Hamas' crimes have been documented and archived. You can review them below.

17b8xaj,A History of Palestine inciting Violence against Jews and refusing peace offers,"Mufti Hajj Amin Husseini, the leader of Palestine, who denied a GENEROUS treaty proposed by Israel which would have allowed Palestine to retain 77% of ‘their’ land in 1937. Instead, he allied with Nazi Germany and Facist Italy, deporting thousands of Jews to concentration camps (and their deaths).
 
Additionally, he recruited and encouraged many young Palestinian men to join the SS and fight for the Axis Powers (Germany, Japan, Italy). He also made many speeches encouraging and inciting violence and murder of Jews and gleefully aired antisemite propaganda in Palestine to encourage a strong cultural hatred for Jews (which survives to this day) .

He was arrested by France in 1945 for his connection with Nazi Germany, but escaped to Egypt a year later and continued inciting violence and slaughter of Jews, as well as refusals of ANY peace treaties until the day he died. 

YasserArifat was another Palestinian leader who refused all peace treaties and responded to attempts of mediation with violence and acts of terror. When offered the Oslo Peace treaty in July 2000, he responded by sending organized waves of suicide bombers into Israeli streets to kill as many civilians as possible, as well as other terrorist attacked aimed at civilians s The final Israeli death toll was 1184. 

In 2005 Israel evacuated its citizens from areas near the Gaza strip, as an offer of peace and a ‘buffer’ to end fighting and violence. The palestinians responded by sending missiles at civilians, again. 

In 2008, Israel once MORE offered a peace treaty to Arafats successor, Saeb Erekat denied all negotiation attempts by saying that they refuse to compromise or ‘’Budge one inch’’ from their demands.

In 2019,  the US offered Palestine ‘the deal of a century’ which gives Palestine 13% of Israeli territory in exchange for 3% of territory bordering other countries, and a plea for  them to simply STOP THEIR TERRORISM. It also offered a section of Jerusalem, although it retains the title of Israeli capital, basically splitting it and giving Palestine control of the East and North sides, so both religions that claimed the Holy City could have ownership. The deal also allowed Palestinians to live in Israeli territory as permanent citizens.  They denied. 

Time and time again, Palestine has taught and encouraged antisemitism and genocide towards the Jews, and have declined ANY possibility of a peace treaty, despite having many many chances.

whenever you ask a Palestinian a question about a solution. they will take a pause and instead of getting a response they will deflect to anything else.

- “Where should the Israelis go”

- “what do you mean? What about the the Palestinians that were displaced where should they go?”

- “How do you feel about the people held hostage”

- “okay um what about the thousands of people that have been killed by IDF for decades. What about that?”

like just answer the damn question. someone is asking what you think a solution would be and you’re not even saying anything. it’s so frustrating.

you’re the one proposing “Free Palestine”. and realistically we need to have solutions. And i don’t see anyone on the “Free Palestine” side offer solutions

Please Arabs. What do you see in them? They are bringing Palestine behind, even accusations of them stealing aid trucks. HAMAS LEADERS FLED THE COUNTRY. 

And before anyone says anything, I understand that before Oct 7 the history is long and intricate, but I implore you to answer this:

Does our Islamic religion advocate for massacring innocent people? Because that's what happened on Oct 7 by Hamas!!

Please use your heads. Not every one in Palestine wants to fight this war they are normal people and don't deserve what Hamas is deciding for them.

I understand the perspective that IDF has killed innocent Palestinians. It is also true some extremist Israelis are cheering for those actions. Similarly though, there have been massive protests by the same nation against those same actions and government.

THE HAMAS LEADERSHIP IS OUT OF THE COUNTRY DO YOUR RESEARCH. Lookup Khaled Mashal and Ismail Haniyeh .They used donation money to leave the country and their sons are all rich businessmen. HAMAS leaders are Greedy and selfish individuals who use Palestinians to make money and gain power. These are the people calling for everyone ELSE to fight for them and pointing fingers at other Arabs and even Palestinians. 

و أحكيلكم بالعربي كمان حماس خربو فلسطين و جابو النار

 وين خالد مشعل و  و إسماعيل هنيه! روح ابحث شوف وينهم . 


 And how does it fix anything to fight fire with fire? If they have killed Palestinian innocents, what does it fix to kill Israelis and cheer for it, calling for their doom, then acting surprised when some of them have the same mentality? 

Did you forget your fathers and grandfathers were the ones who welcomed your Jewish brothers into the country with open arms?

Israelis: Please, understand that not all Arabs and Muslims support Hamas. Some of us see Israelis as normal civilians, which is exactly what they are, people born in a land with all this history attached to it.

Your government, military, and extremist people don't represent your everyday normal Jewish Israeli. Just like our extremists and Hamas don't represent Islam and Arabs.

I hope we can keep a respectful dialogue from both sides on this. 

I hope we can one day have peace. 

We pray to the same god, and we are connected by religious ties closer than any other. We both avoid pork and we both have big noses. Find commonalities, we’re all human and share this earth.

18ud8u8,Freed hostage Mia Schem: ‘I experienced hell. There are no innocent civilians in Gaza’,"After 54 days in captivity- Mia Schem had been released from Hamas.

Her interview that was posted yesterday by Israeli media, in the interview she is talking about her captivity and it brings out a lot of questions- a lot of people are talking about the ""innocent civilians"" in Gaza but Mia is talking about those- the kids who would mock her, laugh at her, take food from her and the wives who had witnessed everything and starved her on purpose.

Are there any innocents there? do they all comply and even happily collaborate with Hamas? it brings to mind the pictures of the kidnapped being released by the red cross- how Palestinians will gather around them, mock them, take pictures of them, try to scare them as they leave- all in civilian clothing.

&#x200B;

some quotes:

“It’s important to me to reveal the real situation about the people who live in Gaza, who they really are, and what I went through there,” she told Channel 13 news. “I experienced hell. Everyone there are terrorists… there are no innocent civilians, not one,” she said. “\[Innocent civilians\] don’t exist.”

He “started to touch me, in the upper part of my body,” gesturing toward her chest. “And I started to scream, to go crazy, amid the burning cars, the bodies.” Then the terrorist, she said, saw the situation with her arm and “recoiled, and stopped for a moment.”

Schem said she didn’t see the face of the person who operated on her, but “he looked at me and he said, ‘You’re not going home alive.'”

She described a moment when one of the youngest children of the family entered her room, “opened a bag of sweets, closed it, came up next to me, opened the bag, closed it and then left.”

Schem said she believes the only reason her captor did not rape her is that “his wife and children were in the next room. His wife hated the fact that he was alone in the room with me. Hated it. So she would play games with me.”

His wife would bring her husband food, “and not bring me food,” she recounted. “A day, two days, three days, I wouldn’t eat… She was so terrible, she had mean eyes. She was a very evil woman.”

Made it into ""browns and whites"" or ""colonizers and oppressed"" they are constantly saying things like ""idc what the Zionists think, I'm gonna call it an ethno-state"". It's like they are actively anti-learning. They are anti-learning. It will ruin their sick little game of evil crackers against the  poor and oppressed.

ur5kmp,The narrative that there was Arab-Jew peace before Zionism is hilarious,"Seeing r/Palestine has a lot of fresh comments about how 'the Jews and Arabs got along until those Zionists came!' What a joke. Is there a single Arab country, of the 22 of them, that has peace within itself? Here's a noncomprehensive list of Arab attacks of Jews, all not instigated in any way:

18eqoq8,The vast majority of people who lived in the kibbutzim were pro-Palestinian activists.,"The vast majority of people who lived in the kibbutzim attacked on 7/10 were left-wing/woke people, pro-Palestinian activists. People who worked very close to the population of Gaza, who took children to Israeli hospitals for cancer treatments, people who gave work to the Gazans in the southern camps, people who many of them
They considered them part of their families.

One of them worked for 30 years as a gardener in Be'eri, slept in the houses of its inhabitants, ate at their tables with their families.

Several survivors recognized him among their executioners, he was the one who made the map of the kibbutz, who detailed each house, how many rooms, how many inhabitants, how many children and even how many pets lived there.

The left-wing/wokes, naive and dreamers, like all leftists/wokes thought that they could live together in peace, that the years of relationship with these people had forged a friendship, that they saw them as allies, that they were not their enemies.

The Gazans, in turn, repaid that trust in the form of rape, torture, mutilation, beheadings, kidnappings and fire.

You, those who raise their flags and take ownership of their struggle, sooner or later will suffer the same fate, some because they are Jews and others because they are simple infidels, but in the long run all of you will be betrayed and you will learn the hard way that friendship and trust placed in barbarians is always reciprocated with a stab in the back.

ts4xds,I'm tired of it all,"I'm sure I will get hate from both sides but I need to vent. 

I'm Israeli, and I'm just tired of it all. I'm tired of war, and death and occupation and terrorism and just no end in sight. 

Im tired of our side and theirs. Of the radicals and the politicians with no skin in the game and all those profiting on the blood spilt of Israelis and Palestinians who deserve to live in peace and self determination. 

Both Palestinian and Israeli security and military leadership has been advocating for two-state solution and a proper peace process for decades and no one in the political system will listen. 

Israelis are held captive on one side politicians and settlers (most of whom have never served a day in uniform) who are happy to subjugate Palestinians forever and on the other side by ultra orthodox (who also never serve in uniform) who will agree to any policy that allows them to impose religious will on the rest of us. 

Palestinians are held captive by a leadership that is financially corrupt, refuses to have fair elections, a financial reward system for killing civilians, and a toxic education system that celebrates violence and terrorism. 

My grandfather fought here, as did my father, and as did I and as will my children. I have given my hearing, my brain, my back and my knees for this country. Many others haven given even more. What have our sacrifices accomplished, what closer are we to peace?

Hey! I've been on this subreddit for a month now, and I have noticed that I feel a lot of ppl are putting words into the mouths of the Palestinians. I, personally feel like the Palestinian pov is not as heavy as the Israeli pov here, and I would like to fix that.

So, anyone can ask me anything about the Israeli-Palestinian situation, and get my point of view as a Palestinian. I also welcome any other Palestinians on this subreddit to post their opinions and answer the questions too. The questions can be anything and everything from the recent situation to protest chants to the future to the history(I'm not 100% well-versed in the history but this subreddit taught me a lot)

I'm looking for actual discussion and listening and understanding from both sides. I'll come back to this in a couple of hours.

*Edit*: also something I want to mention is pls don’t call us Arabs by doing so ur removing our identity  and feeding into Orientalism . Not all Arabs are the same! 

FYI: This is coming from a younger Palestinian and that's why I feel like words are being put in our mouths bc that might be how our elders thought but I fully believe it no longer encompasses the majority of the younger generation's views and opinions.

18xtzbg,I find the pro-palestian side to be the most virulent racists against the Palestinians.,"Argument is pretty simple:

Here’s the axiom: October 7th was an absolutely disgusting and unforgivable act that no context could ever morally justify.

And yet….

I consistently see people on the pro Palestinian side pull out the _but how do you expect the Palestinians to react?? For hundreds of years they have dealt with oppression and hatred from the Israelis and Nakba and etc etc…_

My issue with this line of argumentation is simple:

1. It attempts to “contextualize an event (October 7) that absolutely no context could ever justify and

2. It completely takes away the moral agency of the Palestinians who join Hamas.

The argument basically boils down to _”well of course they acted like deranged, psychotic animals!! How else would you expect them to react to hundreds of years oppression?!?”_

This line of thinking is incredibly racist in that it lowers the bar for human behavior by the Palestinians down to the level of animalistic barbarians.

Is there another culture that the pro Palestinians would say this about?

The IRA (in the eighties) was a terrorist organization who, like Hamas, thought that their homeland (Northern Ireland) had been stolen from them and that Ireland had been oppressed by the British for hundreds of years….

And they were right: the British oppressed the shit out of the Irish! (The question of whether or not Northern Ireland was _stolen_ is another debate).

So let’s do a thought experiment:

Imagine if, believing this, the IRA went to London and raped a bunch of women in their homes and kidnapped them and brought them back to Dublin to hide whilst murdering over a thousand londoners.

How many people…. Hell…. How many _Irish_ people- Irish people who _despised_ the British… how many of them would continue to support the IRA after a stunt like that?

How much of the world would say “well- we condemn the action but you know- the IRA are really freedom fighters and after all that British oppression the Brits kinda had it coming”?

Vanishingly few.

How quickly would the Irish public turn over the IRA rapists and murderers to British law enforcement if they did that?

It’s tough to imagine that the British would even _need_ a bombing campaign as the Irish would likely beat the perpetrators to death themselves…..

My point is that the world- including the Irish public- would immediately condemn the IRA for everything and there would be universal condemnation.

So why would we give the IRA (who, TBF, did blow up a bus at one point and receive extreme blowback for it) moral agency enough to say “you should know better…. Don’t act like animals!” But we deny that same moral standard for the Palestinians??

Why is it tha Hamas is given these free passes to act like animals while we hold other cultures to a higher moral standard?",03/01/24 21:01:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18xtzbg/i_find_the_propalestian_side_to_be_the_most/,203,711,476,Israeli,top,all
184zhlr,Gazan citizens hand hostage to Hamas.,"Yesterday 13 Israelis were released, 1 dual Russia -israeli and a bunch of Thai.

The Russian wasn't part of deal but Putin talked to Hamas and hit him.

This guy was held hostage since 7 oct. At some point an Israeli bomb exploded the house he was in and he managed to escape. For four days he managed to stay free even getting close to the Israeli border. Hamas didn't manage to find him (maybe they weren't trying, perhaps they thought he died in the strike).

Finally some gazans civillians found him and handed him to Hamas to countinue being a hostage and possible torture. 

Hamas themselves claim that there are 40 Israeli hostages in captivity of Gazans citizens not Hamas affiliated. That's one of their excuses for the cease fire.

Remember this next time a bomb explodes. Out of 240 (or maybe separate) there are 40 hostages being held by ""innocent"" civilians. So between 10-15% of the hostages are held by civilians.

Also look at the pictures of oct 7 and see the amount of teens and women who are presumably not in Hamas participating.

I'm not claiming everyone in Gaza is evil. I'm just showing there definitely are plenty. In external studies, it's been found roughly 55 percent of Gazans support Hamas.

Here is what we can see in this video:

- The house is in a civilian area, surrounded by civilian house.
- The operators wait patiently for civilians to evacuate nearby buildings, and for few civilians on the street to pass by.
- When the coast is clear, there is a small strike to blow off the roof of the building to verify what's inside.
- A couple rocket launchers are seen flying out of the building, confirming the use of the building for launching rockets.
- The operators receive permission for a full strike.
- After striking the building, the operators recognize a secondary explosion taking place, indicating there were explosives stored inside the building.
- Eventually, you see a huge barrage of haphazard rockets coming out of the building and landing all over the place, which had been stored there and set off by the explosion.
- It seems to me that a large amount of collateral damage is caused by these rockets that had been stored in the building.",21/05/21 12:17:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nhr44e/anatomy_of_an_israeli_airstrike_in_gaza/,189,137,192,Israeli,top,all
18xbq8l,Jesus was Jewish.,"Jesus was a Jew.

Let's say in 1830 a boy named Juan is born in California. At the time, California is Mexican territory. His family then moves to Guadalajara. In Guadalajara, he grows up as a Mexican and eventually becomes a politician.

His campaign is so successful, that he eventually becomes the president of Mexico. In the 1850s, the USA annexes California.

Since California is now American territory, and Juan was born there, is Juan a US American? No. He's a Mexican. He was literally the president of Mexico.

Now let's talk about Anik. Anik was born in the now Toronto area. Anik was born in the year 532. Anik was a member of the local Inuit tribe. Anik eventually became leader of the local Inuit tribe. If you asked Anik if he's a Canadian, he would not know what that means.

Anik is not Canadian. Anik is Inuit.


Now imagine you're in Bethlehem. In Bethlehem, a boy named Yeshua is born. Yeshua is a Hebrew name. As a baby, Yeshua's family moved to Nazareth. Yeshua was born and raised in judea, just different parts. Yeshua became the king of the Jews. If you asked Yeshua if he's Palestinian, he would not know what you mean.

Yeshua is not Palestinian.
Yeshua is Jewish.

I really don't understand why anyone would say that Jesus was Palestinian. Every claim made to support that is ridiculous. No other ethnic group would tolerate one of it's most famous figures being stripped away like that.

No one would walk up to a Ukrainian born in Mariupol and call them Russian.
No one would walk up to a Palestinian born in Gaza city and call them Israeli.

1bs1oc7,Disturbing video shows Jewish convert fatally shot by IDF in West Bank posed no threat,"[*Disturbing video shows Jewish convert fatally shot by IDF in West Bank posed no threat*](https://www.timesofisrael.com/disturbing-video-shows-jewish-convert-fatally-shot-by-idf-in-west-bank-posed-no-threat/) — to summarize for those who aren't aware, a Palestinian convert to Judaism named David Avraham was shot and killed by an IDF soldier at a bus stop for having a knife in his backpack. This is despite Avraham having his hands up and standing away from the backpack at the time of the shooting (the surveillance video is quite disturbing in that regard); he was also apparently well-known in the community as a legitimate convert to Judaism for years despite the IDF soldier in the video apparently doubting that. 

I think that this is a terrible look for the IDF, and a legitimate punishment needs to be handed down to the soldier who killed Avraham (though unlikely). The fact that Avraham was denied Israeli residency i.e. a ""right of return"" for *years*, obviously due to his Palestinian heritage, also provides more fuel for the people who claim Israeli discriminates by race and/or perpetuates apartheid. I would like to know if there were doubts as to whether his conversion to Judaism was legitimate. I also have questions about this supposed knife, which is simply referred to as a ""small knife"" in the article. Standard pocketknife? 

I'm mainly posting this to keep an eye on the case as I suspect, as with 90+% of cases involving IDF violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, that the soldier who killed him will ultimately be let go or only face a slap on the wrist. I unfortunately think that the pocket knife Avraham had tucked away in his backpack will be enough to exonerate the soldier *(even though he was standing away from his backpack with his hands up when he was killed)*, contributing to the perpetuating cycle of hatred with no accountability on both sides . . . what do Israelis here think of this incident, and what punishment the IDF soldier should face compared to the one he'll likely get? And what are your thoughts on Palestinian converts to Judaism in general?

To get my broader point across, does anyone remember this other case from two years ago? Probably not (it's just one of many): [*Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian teen. The army hasn’t said what he did wrong*](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-troops-shot-dead-a-palestinian-teen-the-army-hasnt-said-what-he-did-wrong/). Hint: they *still* haven't said anything. So if you stumble upon this post two years later and learn that nothing was done to this IDF soldier who killed Avraham either, you'll understand why I made it and maybe understand why Palestinians in the West Bank aren't so compliant and friendly with their occupiers who can kill them with near-impunity xD",31/03/24 04:21:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bs1oc7/disturbing_video_shows_jewish_convert_fatally/,179,334,444,Israeli,top,all

All credit for the above links and comment goes to ThebesAndSound from the news reddit. No one pro Palestinian should gaslight again. This is irrefutable, and undeniable. I am sick and tired of all this gaslighting and mental gymnastics, and all this parroting of ""hasbara, Israeli propaganda"" open your eyes people, this conflict isn't as simple as ""oppressed"" and ""oppressor"". There has been atrocities committed by BOTH SIDES, and if we want peace ALL pro Palestinians and Pro Israeli's should agree that HAMAS, for the good of Palestinians, and Israeli's need to be wiped out to the last man.

No one who is pro palestinian should be supporting Hamas, and everyone who claims they are ""resistance fighters"" are mistaken, if Hamas targeted military installations on October 7th then I wouldn't feel so harsh towards them, even if Israelis civilian's were killed in the crossfire, but the fact that they deliberately and intentionally targeted civilians is inexcusable. The biggest obstacle to peace in the Levant is Hamas, Hamas even killed over 1000 of their own people during and after the Fatah Hamas conflict in Gaza. There is footage of them throwing their own people off roofs simply for supporting Fatah, who Hamas deemed as not being as ""Islamic"" and non secular as they should be.

If you are pro palestinian, please think clearly. The people of Gaza deserve better than Hamas, the Gazans and Israelis' have one thing in common; Hamas are the enemies of both.

18680al,Stop downplaying treatment of hostages.,"It’s enough. No matter which end you’re coming from here, becoming a hostage is a life changing experience for the worst. It’s nothing but lifelong PTSD looking over your shoulder and wondering when you will be taken. No matter if the treatment is “fair” or if when being returned you’re told to “keep waving,” becoming a hostage means you may never see your home, friends, or family again. If you do see them again, now the worry becomes *when* and not *if* it will happen again. 

It’s disgusting to see videos being released and the display of hostages notably telling their stories of, “we were treated so well…” Stop. They were taken without consent and without knowledge of a safe return. 

No matter which end you see this from, understand that being a hostage is a life changing experience and pointing at anything and comparing treatments is ridiculous and reductive to the safety of those it impacts.

o49jqp,Mythbusters - Sterilization of Ethiopian Jews,"A point repeatedly brought up while discussing racism (or ""apartheid"") in Israel is the forced sterilization of Ethiopian Jewish women. [Newspapers have reported it](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-ethiopians-fooled-into-birth-control-1.5226424), [slightly less reputable newspapers have reported it](http://www.africanglobe.net/africa/evidence-israel-sterilized-ethiopian-jews/) and like everything, [it eventually found its way to reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackLivesMatter/comments/nc7rh1/did_you_know_that_israel_forcibly_sterilised_its/). Comparisons have been made to human experimentation in the Shoah[^(\[1\])](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseknutsen/2013/01/28/israel-foribly-injected-african-immigrant-women-with-birth-control/?sh=61c022b967b8), and where the Shoah is mentioned, can articles like [this](https://bennorton.com/israel-white-supremacy-anti-black-racism-african-refugees-ethiopian-jews/) be far behind.

So, what are the facts

**Were they sterilized?**

Planned birth control broadly falls into these categories

1. Natural birth control - Pulling out, not having sex during ovulational etc.
2. Oral contraceptives, popularly called birth control pills.
3. Long-acting reversible contraception - Including implants, devices, injections etc.
4. Sterilization - Vasectomies for men, tubal ligation, salpingectomy and hysterectomy(absolutely not recommended) for women.

As you can see, only the fourth point is called sterilization, the only permanent method of birth control. The rest are temporary methods of birth control, including the injections used in our case - [Depo-Provera](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/depo-provera/about/pac-20392204). It is sometimes called a Depo shot or simply, birth control shot.

Depo Provera has almost no long lasting effects. It need to be renewed every 12-13 weeks to be effective and if there are any lingering side effects, they go away within a year of stopping the injections. No matter how long you have taken Depo Provera, you will be able to conceive if you go off the shot (provided you would have been able to conceive without it in the first place)

Ergo, no long lasting side effects. This was observed even in our case, where Ethipian women who went off the shot could conceive without problems.

&#x200B;

**Why were they given any kind of birth control?**

Ethiopian Jews came to Israel from either transit camps. Without going into details, transit camps are like temporary refugee camps. And refugee camps have a pressing need for birth control. This is for many reasons

1. Most refugee camps are overflowing and cannot handle increased populations[^(\[3\])](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=8ff1d1534e8c41adb5c04ab435b7974b)
2. Maternal mortality rates are high. [^(\[4\])](https://www.unfpa.org/resources/maternal-mortality-humanitarian-crises-and-fragile-settings)
3. So are mortality rates associated with abortions [^(\[5\])](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1016/S0968-8080%2802%2900026-5)
4. Gynecologists on the other hand, are in short supply.
5. Sexual violence is high.[^(\[6\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6752644/)
6. Postpartum care is mostly unavailable.[^(\[7\])](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17441692.2018.1516796?forwardService=showFullText&tokenAccess=8SSS4u9Nhwadakmk258x&tokenDomain=eprints&doi=10.1080%2F17441692.2018.1516796&doi=10.1080%2F17441692.2018.1516796&journalCode=rgph20)

The overwhelming need for birth control in refugee camps is best summed up by this article -  [At refugee camps, birth control is crucial and in short supply — Quartz (qz.com)](https://qz.com/676226/refugees-in-greece-need-birth-control-and-this-turkish-organization-is-helping-them-get-it/)

Without birth control, refugee camps find it almost impossible to function, and there are times when healthcare providers in refugee camps ask for birth control to take priority over other medications.

&#x200B;

**Are women forced (or threatened) to take them?**

No. There are little to no refugee camps where contraception/sterilization/birth control is forced. A report into this by Israel suggests that no such threats were made.

**Are they browbeaten into taking them?**

Almost certainly. We can discuss the ethical implications of a woman's body and her choice, and I welcome that discussion. But we must keep in mind that in the case of refugee camps, doctors are fighting a very real threat - of high maternal and infant mortality. There just aren't enough people to provide women the care they need, and this is a good temporary preventive measure.

Another advantage of injections like Depo-Provera is light to no mensuration, which is great because refugee women also don't have access to pads/tampons/cups, which leads to higher infections. Sexual violence is also a big problem due to increased need to use the mostly non-gender segregated toilets.

In most cases, women are informed of what they are taking, but there are language barriers that sometimes causes this information to be lost in translation.

I have worked as a surgeon in a lot of refugee camps. So, this is anecdotal, but we were asked to communicate to every patient that birth control was available to them, and could have benefits for them. Quite a few female patients had tried to either self administer or participate in an unsafe abortion which led to bleeding, infections etc., and we always insisted on birth control for them. And I am not even a gynecologist.

**Did Israel browbeat them?**

Transit camps for Ethiopian refugees in Sudan were not run by Israel. Even in later operations, most transit camps were administered by local officials.  American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee did play a role in them, but not the Israeli government. A report commissioned by the government in 2016 found as such. 

&#x200B;

**But why aren't men?**

Good question. It's because of sexual violence. Giving women birth control means they are less likely to get pregnant than giving their husbands vasectomies and hoping they don't get raped.

**But why don't they give them daily medication like pills?**

It is true that pills are the most common form of birth control. And it is certainly true for Israel. This leads to mistaken headlines like ""Depo-Provera is only given to Ethiopian Jews' or 'It is a means of last resort"". In some ways, that is true. But not in refugee camps. Because daily birth control is expensive. Depo-Provera turns out to be the cheapest means of reliable temporary birth control. And thus, this is what gets shipped to refugee camps[^(\[8\])](https://rbc.gov.rw/publichealthbulletin/img/RPHB%202%20issue%204%20article%203.pdf). It's use is overwhelmingly prevalent in refugee camps. Also, while less talked about, a lot of women hawk their daily birth control medication to get money for other things. They also become target of thefts.

&#x200B;

**But why are we talking about refugee camps? They live in Israel.**

True. But one thing transit camps are surprisingly good at keeping are medical records. So, when these women arrived in Israel, the physicians just looked at the chart, asked if they wanted to continue the medication and gave them another injection.

It is not standard procedure to explain what the injections do at each administration. So, the women who did not know about the injections never found out. And those who were pushed into it never got a second opinion.

So the practice of taking Depo-Provera mostly continued unimpeded, which led to a marked decrease in childbirths among Ethiopian women.

**OK, but they could stop it once they found out.**

And they did. The new recommendation is to not renew the injection automatically, but to administer it as if it were the first time. As in, to explain what it does, it's side effects, it's long term use etc. before recommending it. Money for birth control isn't a problem in Israel, so a lot of women opt for birth control pills because they give you more flexibility, as you can get pregnant almost immediately after you stop taking it.

**But why only black women?**

Because in the recent years, only Ethiopian women came as refugees to Israel. And while many Bnei Manasseh Jews have made it to Israel, they come from a relatively stable country and definitely not from refugee camps (though India had it's own problems with sterilization).

A common accusation thrown around in this case is laughable false, because Israel explicitly worked to import these Jews to the country. Mossad launched operations for it, large scale airlifts were planned and executed. The Law of Return does not actually require such operations. Israel could have weaponized bureaucracy to make sure they never made it to Israel.

18hn35a,Language issue on the Pro-Palestine side,"Background then question:

 I didn’t realize I was “pro-Israel” until after 10/7 when I found out to my dismay that my left-leaning friends were either pro-Hamas or justifying Hamas’ actions and also thought that the “colonial settler state of Israel” needed to be destroyed.  I am aware of many criticisms of Israeli policy and am willing to have a conversation about any of them, provided the person does not defend or excuse the actions of Hamas on 10/7 and provided the person can at least see that calling for the destruction of Israel is at least de facto calling for a genocide against Jews.  So I’m pretty open to criticizing Israeli policy and how it wages war.

The question I have is, has anyone else noticed the vague and inaccurate language being used by pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian people ?  I spend most of the time when speaking with these people trying to get them to define their terms and then seeing them move the goal posts when cornered.  “Genocide,” “carpet bombing,” “colonialist,” “apartheid,” “racism,” etc: none of these words are being used correctly or accurately and It makes it impossible to have a real conversation. It seems like the words are chosen for their emotional impact rather than their accuracy. They also seem to obfuscate what “from the river to the sea,” “globalize the intifada” etc actually mean which makes me feel like I’m not dealing with people being honest about heir intentions, I’m very frustrated by this because I think there is a genuine conversation to have but it’s not really possible to have it. Question is, do others share this experience and what’s the way forward if this is a generalizable experience?",13/12/23 18:10:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18hn35a/language_issue_on_the_propalestine_side/,170,615,284,Israeli,top,all
1bs9kmk,I am scared ,"This is getting harder and harder every day

In the videos of the anti Israel protestors they seem to be getting angrier and angrier. Even on college campuses there is a level of rage that is not normal in regular western protests. The video of the students at Vanderbilt, where students broke into the admin building, what would have happened if they encountered Jews? They were willing to physically push over an armed security guard in an act of rage. What was their end goal? Not to mention these are mostly affluent children who are spending $100,000s of thousands to attend these schools. These aren’t disenfranchised middle eastern youth. These are our future leaders, doctors and teachers. It feels less and less like earnest activism and more like the beginnings of a pogrom. 

I grew up learning a lot of the plight of Jews in Europe. As I got older I started learning about the plight of my family’s history in Iraq. Learning about those events through conversation, books and videos I am learning the the language used to rile up anti Jewish sentiment 100 years ago sounds very similar to the language we are hearing from anti Israel protestors today. This is also scary because much of this is promoted by people in our society who are considered smart and intelligent. We often say that education trumps ignorance, so I understand why a well meaning intelligent young person with no connection to the conflict would trust an anti Israel professor over an American conservative (ik conservatives don’t like us either).

I have not once heard a pro Palestinian discuss peace, talk about improving Palestinian economic mobility, talk about improving Palestinian leadership, or even consider the Israeli/jewish perspective. While the Israeli side has bigots and war mongers there is a diversity of thought and there is deliberation about our future. There are also people who vocally promote peace. 

If “pro Palestinians” truly cared about Palestinian lives and sovereignty there would be different schools of pro Palestinian thought. There would be an exchange of ideas and deliberation to make their lives better. Instead they blindly support “resistance” and spew Hamas and Iranian propaganda not knowing the longer Hamas is in power, the longer Iran and Russia support their resistance, the longer Palestinians will suffer. This movement does not care about Palestinians, this movement hates Jews and the west,  even if for most westerners that is not their willing intention or desire. 

Anyway, I’m 25 and I feel pretty lost. I grew up listening to One Day by Matisyahu, a song about ending the fighting and dreaming of peace. I was raised believing in peace believing that one day the fighting could stop. But my peers don’t really seem to care. 

I wish this stuff didn’t affect me this much but ever since 10/7 I haven’t really felt the same. I’m jealous of my pro Palestinian peers that post propaganda then just post a regular picture of them at brunch or at a concert. They get to move on. They get to be a “hero” and then turn it off when they want. We don’t! 

My grandfather who was born in Baghdad made a comment that he doesn’t know if Jews will be safe in America in the near future and that really worried me and it made me sad that he has to experience again this same climate that led to his brothers being tortured, his father being murdered and his family getting kicked out of a land they lived in for over 2,000 years. 

I still hope coexistence and peace is possible. I don’t know if I’ll see it in my lifetime but i will pray everyday for it. Whoever reads this Jew, Palestinian, leftist college student, just know I support your peace and your desire to live a safe life. I wish you and your  family wealth and health for generations to come even if you don’t wish the same for me.

1aqf7d4,"Hamas was offered an end to siege, reconstruction, airport, for a permanent ceasefire. They said no.","This is the smoking gun. This is an article from Al-Mayadeen, a Pro-Hamas Hezbollah newspaper in Lebanon from 2021. Israel offered Hamas an end to the siege, reconstruction of Gaza at Israeli expense, an airport and a seaport, a whole new city built for them by Israel, and creation of jobs for Palestinians whose lives have been devastated.

The only term Hamas needed to accept was a permanent ceasefire. Stop trying to kill us. The same permanent ceasefire that everyone is calling for now.

Hamas saw it as ""temptation"" and rejected it. I repeat, this is from a pro-Hamas newspaper that has no reason to lie about this.

If you believe Israel is genocidal and wants Gazans dead or ethnically cleansed, why are they offering this?

When did the Serbs say ""We'll end the violence, end the siege of Srebrenica, rebuild Srebrenica at Serbian expense, build a whole new city for Bosniaks as compensation, and help them reacclimate - let's just coexist without fighting.""

We can have peace! 25 thousands Gazans should still be alive! No one should have died on October 7th! Gaza could and can be free from siege, with Gazans free to move around the world. Gaza city is bigger than Tel Aviv - imagine how beautiful it could be if Israel and Palestine worked together to rebuild it!

Israel offered this as recently as 2.5 years ago. If Hamas wants, it can still happen. They don't need to surrender or disband - just agree to rule Gaza in peace.

Again, this offer was reported by a Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper in Lebanon that wants Israel destroyed. There is zero motivation for them to lie.

1aoskbq,Israel's Rescue of Hostages Shows The Difference in their Values,"Israel just rescued two hostages.  The operation risked the lives of dozens of  Israeli soldiers.  This is in keeping with the well known value Israel places on the lives of their citizens, whether they be Arab or Jew.

Hamas shoots rockets from civilian occupied areas, and stole the foreign aid to build bunkers to hide themselves and not the Gazans.  They've been captured on video shooting civilians who dared to try to get a portion of the international humanitarian aid that Hamas steals as soon as they enter through Rafah.  

It is a clear difference in the values of the Israelis and Hamas.  Yet, Hamas was popularly elected and had majority popular support even through the early part of this war.  It was well known that Hamas was genocidal, anti-semitic, fascistic, anti-democratic, and in virtually every way Hamas behaved as selfish despots who abused the Gazans.  The Gazans who nevertheless publicly and privately supported them.

The difference in culture is not simply between Israeli and Hamas, but between Israeli and Gazan.  Golda Meir said it a half century ago, ""Peace will come when the Arabs will love their children more than they hate us.""  That day is not yet here.

People can lie and claim Israel is genocidal, and whitewash Hamas' true genocidal claims.  But the truth is evident in how they treat their own people.  Genocidal regimes treat their own citizens as disposable garbage.  Countries that value their own citizens' lives, and prioritize them over their own military, and struggle to save them, do not commit genocide.

18l9h9v,"The ""Indigenous"" thing","Drives me nuts. It's used to legitimize residency but also deligitmize the other group's residency, and it's done unilaterally. 

Muslims came throughout many periods to settle in Israel. Jews left then came back also throughout many periods. Christianity literally started in Israel.

Intermarriage, conversion, expulsión , returns. 

There's no point in telling Jews to go back to where they came from, they will tell you they came from here. Jews tried to live abroad, they were murdered for it all over the world (yes including the Arab world which everyone seems to forget). Some jews tried to forget Israel and Judaism, but the nations of the world refused to let that happen. So we came back. Jews sing for a return to Jerusalem in prayers and even at weddings, before the cup is crushed. Al-Aqtsa is one of Islam's holy sites? Israel is our -only- holy land. Al-Aqsta sits on our -most- holy site, the temple grounds, where we believe God is closest, and we are pathetically left to pray to a silly wall. If you don't think Jews should live in Israel, then the only conclusion left is that Jews shouldn't exist, period. This is the most important thing in the religion. Living in Israel is like making Hajj every day. My parents are not even religious Jews, and this is how they feel. ""Settler-colonialism"" makes zero sense in this context. 

Likewise, there is no point in telling Palestinians they shouldn't be here. There's no point in saying they don't have nationalistic tendencies, they clearly do. It doesn't really matter when they started, it's been long enough now. They are willing to commit horrible acts of violence and let their children die for this nationalism. What Israelis should be doing is commending peaceful political organization while continuing to condemn and fight violent organization. This is what any sane Pro-palestine person should be doing. Not telling Jews to leave, not pushing this crazy idea that Jews live under Palestine government (which will promptly slaughter them just as they do to each other like Hamas did to PLO).

1bu0hct,Question for Israel Supporters: What would actually be too far?,"As the title asks, what would be too far an act for Israel to commit?

I ask this question in the wake of the Israeli murder of aid workers via air strike. To most of the watching world the frequent IDF atrocities are abhorrent and unfortunately nothing new, ongoing since the terror spread by Irgun/Lehi terrorists of the past. There's video evidence of IDF atrocities, including singing songs whilst desecrating bodies.

If you're an Israel supporter, where would the final straw actually be for you to relinquish your support?",02/04/24 14:43:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bu0hct/question_for_israel_supporters_what_would/,165,2191,89,Israeli,top,all
18vtrmj,I actually hate Hamas and don't get why everyone is hating on Israel,"Before we begin, I am aware that this is a controversial topic and that people may have other ideas and opinions about it. If you disagree with me, then stop reading here and find another post to read.

This is not to say that I hate Palestine as a country, but I hate the way most of the civilians there blindly  support Hamas. This is not an exaggeration. This link- [https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-shows-soaring-support-for-hamas-in-west-bank-as-90-say-abbas-should-resign/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-shows-soaring-support-for-hamas-in-west-bank-as-90-say-abbas-should-resign/) \-here shows at least 72% backing Hamas and thinking that it was right of them to attack Israel. And also the way so many people support Palestine while antagonising Israel. 

I myself am not Israeli, but support them because I am Christian and Israel is God's Country, and I will stand with them. And I will continue to do so regardless of what anyone says. Of course, I do feel sorry for the innocent civilians in Israel, and those in Palestine who do not support Hamas. That's not to say that I support Palestine itself, as mentioned earlier the majority of them support Hamas blindly.

Recently, me and a friend were discussing the whole conflict, and I asked who she supported. Without any hesitation, she immediately said ""Palestine, obviously!"". I asked her what she thought about Israel, and she said that all Israelis and Israel supporters encourage genocide, as did Zionists. Then a few days later, another friend messaged me asking why I supported Israel. I responded that I am Christian and that Israel is God's country.

He hasn't talked to me since. It's been over two months now. And almost every other person I talk to supports Palestine. 

I found an article about hostages who were recently freed, and found one of their social media accounts. I clicked the link to see how they were doing, and scrolled through some of the comments. One that particularly shocked me was someone saying ""You owe this to Hamas, be grateful that they treated you humane"".

Explain how shooting and wounding someone until their foot is practically dangling off can possibly be considered humane.

Please just stop hating on Israel and pretending that they are playing the victim. Yes the people in Palestine are going through difficulties too themselves but that doesn't mean that they are the only ones suffering.

174uhjb,"A little historical context... for everyone saying the Jews are illegally ""occupying"""," The Israeli claim on their land goes back 1000 years before Christ, when the Kingdom of David was established and Jerusalem established as the capital. This is the first time Jerusalem pops up in world history. \*\*This is still 1600 years before the rise of Islam\*\*. The Jews have suffered multiple exiles and take overs through that time, including the Assyrian exile in 722 B.C.E, the Babylonian exile 586 B.C.E (in 515 BCE the Jews return), in 63 B.C.E the Romans take over, followed by two Jewish revolts against the romans in 70 C.E. and 130 C.E. which resulted in defeats to the Jews twice. \*\*THAT IS WHEN\*\* when the romans renamed the area ""PALESTINE"" as an insult to the Jews, coming from the word Philistines, their biblical enemies. The first time the name Palestine was used was 136 C.E., a solid 1200 years after the Jews entered the land.

pt73gk,IDF to ban Palestinians from raping their wives,"A rare IDF initiative seeks to impart change on Palestinian society. The IDF, normally highly reluctant to interfere in internal Palestinian affairs, has initiated steps to criminalize rape of Palestinian women by their husbands. Bizarrely, Palestinian and Jordanian laws permitted husbands to force themselves upon their wives, in accordance with ancient Islamic practices. Jordan had recently banned this legal indignity but the Palestinian authority (not to mention Hamas) had not. 

The impetus for the change was a case of an Arab Israeli woman who married a Palestinian man and moved to Area A. The man had beat her and raped her. As an Israeli citizen, she was able to turn to the idf for protection. The IDF arrested the man and charged him with rape. 

This is in my view a perfect example of how absurd claims of systemic oppression and apartheid are. Palestinian society treats women like second class citizens. In Islamist Gaza, women are forbidden from going out at night without a male accompanying them. Women are being excluded from public places by a fanatic fundamentalist regime that’s ran by men. That separation is absolute and permanent and it has no security rationale, but an ideological one. If that’s not apartheid, I don’t know what is…

1aqls31,Thoughts of a reservist - 128 days later,"This is something I've been trying to write down for the past two months or so. Every time i would open the app and try to get the words out, i would either jump from subject to subject, or just not come up with anything. Like i couldn't think of anything.

128 days of duty. That's how long it has been. My unit has been active since around 8AM on October 7th. myself been on active duty since 11AM that day.

Ive been staring at my screen for 10 minutes by now....

Currently, my unit has been relived of duty, and I'm at home for ""re-adjustment time"", which is about a week. but we are not relived entirely. If anything substantial happens in the north, we will be called again. and the war in Lebanon will be significantly more difficult and worse in terms of causalities. 

While i acknowledge that now its 14th of February, some part of me still feels like its stuck on October 7th. Like this is all just one bad dream. And I'm tired.

I'm tired of politicians trying to save their own ass while we are at war, I'm tired of people that eat up whatever the media says without single thought behind it, I'm tired of people half way across the world supporting terrorists, not even trying to understand this whole region we call ""the middle east"".

And I'm conflicted too. I've seen the videos and photos that came after the attack. I've seen how the ""elite"" Nukhba fighters of Hamas killing people at the festival, in their cars, in their own homes. I've also seen the vidoes of ""citizens"" attacking and abducting people. Two days ago, when two abductees were rescued, A High ranking Hamas official that goes by the name Muhammad Nazzal said to Al-Jazeera that the abductees were held by civilians (even though there was a firefight when the house was breached).

When you have an entire education system designed around the idea of Martyrdom, that the best thing to achieve in life is to die ""for the resistance"", when you teach kids songs that praise the killing of jews, there cant be ""innocent civilians"", just like the people of Germany ""Didn't know"" about the Holocaust.

On the other hand, I've also seen videos of people (mainly adults) that curse Hamas, that ask israeli soldiers to not leave, that call Hamas ""Traders of Blood"" that live in Turkey or Qatar, and have left the people to suffer.

17gjead,Double Standards because Israel. I am pissed.,"Israel is the only Jewish state in the entire world, and there are many Arab Muslim states. It baffles me when people say Israel has no right to exist. There is ONE Jewish state in the entire world, and for some reason, they should be destroyed? Israel is a democracy and the most Western-type state in the region. These states, like Lebanon, and increasingly Türkiye, a NATO member mind you, Erdoga from his latest speech to the Turkish General Assembly, called Hamas ""freedom fighters."" This is troubling.

I can understand not liking the government of a country. I don't like the CCP of China; they are authoritarian lunatics and have concentration camps for the Uighur Muslims, but I don't hate the Chinese people. However, for the Arab world, it isn't like this. They just don't hate Israel for the government and separate the government from the average person, but they hate the average person because they are Jewish. They don't even see them as humans... doesn't that remind you of something from the 20th century?

I can't think of any other place in the world where another type of culture wants to completely eliminate the entire people of their only state in the world. We all bleed the same blood, and we all want to live our lives and have a family, etc.

You have these lefties out there, and especially the pro-LGBT crowd out there supporting and in protest for said people who would have them killed at the first moment. I see these 'Queers for Palestine,' and it's like... dude... they will literally kill you for being homosexual. Us in the West is so weird, and I don't understand this alliance the far-left is courting with Hamas. They show support for Hamas openly when Hamas would literally kill them for their sexuality.

Also, the left is always on about racism, and Hamas and other Arab Muslim states wanting to kill all the Jews and destroy the Israeli state is the most definition of racism and bigotry.

186sj16,I am an Arab and this is how I changed my mind about this conflict.,"Hey all,Salam, שלום  Please do not take some of the things I share personally, I am here to share my journey and hopefully have a discussion about it.

First of all, I want to share a bit about myself : I am an Arab, from a Muslim background, culturally Muslim but I identify as an agnostic.

I have been raised in an Arab Moderate muslim household, I was never forced to follow religion and I only prayed when I was younger.I dated a Jewish men for a few months and I still think he was my soul mate, but because I was an Arab and he was Jewish our families could never let us have a future together, so we decided to part ways.

I went through phases in my journey until I made up my mind and decided on the position that I will share with you later in the post. But I can sum up my journey into four phases.

**The first phase:** What my culture taught me, Israelis are evil, horrible human beings, blasphemous Kuffars who hate Arabs and would kill them if they had a chance. A lot of religion Sh\*\*t was also used as a way to push for this narrative.

**The second phase:** Meeting the first Israelis in an exchange program. I was choked to see that they were just regular people with hobbies, families and we actually got along very well.

Becoming more and more open minded towards Israelis, teaching some Israelis online as well and building friendships. All the things my culture told me about Israelis was no longer valid and I even dated a Jewish man, who lived for a while in Israel. He was one of the most generous, kind loving men I have ever met.

I decided that this was not my battle and that I cannot solve it by myself.

So I stopped thinking about it.

**The Third phase** :The attack on October 7th happened and I started to question everything. From friends who were telling me about the horrors that the Israelis experienced to the horrors that I was seeing were happening to the Palestinians. I was utterly confused and could not sleep or eat for two weeks.

I was aching for my friends, as I had Palestinian and Israeli friends and I was sending them messages everyday to check on them.

**The final phase**:I decided to go tabula rasa and be as rational as I can be and try to go back and understand history from both perspectives. I went on Twitter and spent hours debating, being attacked, called a terrorist for defending either Palestinians or Israelis, got insulted, received death threats called names, a terrorist, a Hamas sympathizer, a zionist, a nazi etc...

I read a lot, watched a lot of videos and I came to one conclusion : There is only one solution to this conflict and I don't know when this will happen, but it can only be a secular one state solution for everyone, where everyone learns to leave with the other. If it was done in South Africa, why can't it be done in Israel/Palestine.

If I could change my mind about Israelis and still support Palestinians and still believe that even though so much blood was spilled, there can be hope and there can be a one state for all, secular, democratic, then why can't you?Is it really worth all this pain?",29/11/23 15:49:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/186sj16/i_am_an_arab_and_this_is_how_i_changed_my_mind/,166,608,572,Israeli,top,all
1b5y2cg,Local Gazans make attempt to cooperate on aid behind Hamas's back,"The IDF has begun taking steps to test the rule of local Gazan clans in the Gaza Strip after Hamas was destroyed, according to a report by London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat on Saturday.

According to the report, the head of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Major General Ghassan Alian, was in contact with local leaders who weren't affiliated with Hamas in order to organize the protection of the humanitarian aid convoys by local armed groups.

The report stated that most factions refused, however a large clan reportedly agreed, and another one is considering the proposal.

Sources in Hamas allegedly told Asharq Al-Awsat that the terror group has sufficient information about the communications taking place between Israel and the local clans. They claimed that they are monitoring actions made by local armed men, calling their actions violations and said that their aim is to cause chaos, sabotage and incitement.

The sources also claimed that Hamas leadership has decided to take action against the local groups and that they ""will pay for their actions,"" according to the report.

This report comes following  US airdrop of aid into Gaza, following the aid convoy disaster on Thursday in which over 100 Gazans were killed.

This arrangement is part of a larger plan of cooperation between the IDF and local Gazan clans
This isn't the first report of the IDF trying to collaborate with local groups in Gaza. Israeli officials announced in February that they were interested in establishing Palestinian-run ""humanitarian pockets"" unaffiliated with Hamas.

Israeli officials said the planned ""humanitarian pockets"" would be in districts of the Gaza Strip from which Hamas has been expelled but that their ultimate success would hinge on Israel achieving its goal of destroying the Islamist faction across the tiny coastal territory that it has been governing.

______________________________________

The more Palestinian civilians see Israel is holding it's ground and is determined to win the war, despite the legions of antisemites protesting against it and for Hamas all over the world, the more they will have the courage to come forward and start building a future without Hamas dominating their lives. Hamas's rule is breaking down.

Israel's plan seems to be to keep full operational control in the entire strip (Mostly already achieved), fight terrorist pockets in the years to come while cooperating with local groups.

Then, slowly transferring power while making sure there is no more indoctrination to violence in schools by vile organizations such as UNRWA, and hopefully starting a new era of peace in Gaza in several years.

Reminder, Gaza is a de facto independent Palestinian state. It had a functioning airport, a beach, borders with another country and more. The only reason for the blockade is Hamas and their endless attacks on Israel.

 Just a good example I thought of how easy it is to spin things without context. I see this so often in those spaces - a photo of a crying man and text that he had to operate on his son with no anesthesia, a photo of a sad old couple looking at a house and text saying their house was stolen by Israelis, a photo of a soldier with his hand on the shoulder of a child and text like IDF attacks children on their way to school etc. I have no idea what is true and what isnt but I think this stuff is so dangerous bc you can literally write anything you want on a picture. So much of the content in those spaces is emotional images with no context. And people share these things so readily. Also maybe someone can confirm but isn't Quds a Hamas propoganda site? I suspect that a lot of these sources and bots you see online are backed by Quatari or Iranian sponsors or at the very least Hamas themselves could be pouring money into it, we know funding is no problem for them. Why wouldn't they? They cannot win militarily but this disruption to the West is immensely beneficial to their cause. For Hamas it helps them demand a ceasefire which means they remain in power and for the Iranian-Russian axis the West putting pressure on the US to stop supporting their ally in the middle east is a perfect play on the geopolitical scene. And conditions in the West have made this so easy bc the world is now seen as black and white - oppressor and oppressed- villain and hero and people are comfortable trying to fit an extremely complex into a story of white colonialism. 

 I also know a lot of pro Palestinian sources try to lay on the idea that Israeli hasbara is some kind of master operation. It is so off base in my opinion. European/ American governments support Israel not bc of some mysterious Jewish influence but bc they are part of the American European axis against countries that are hostile to the West (like Iran-Russia) and therefore a strategic ally. Israel did try to found and fund efforts to improve their image especially after the first intifada, of course there is an effort. There's a foreign communication minister in the government. you can see the videos the IDF tried to release from the tunnels but they were sloppy and there was a lot of backlash so it seems they've stopped with that tactic. Overall the effort put into defending themselves online has been pretty weak. In fact Israel has been pretty much focused solely on the war and a good number of the public statements made were not directed at the West at all but we're intended as war trash talk towards Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran- something that seems to characterize military engagement in the middle east and doesn't translate well internationally. A big reason is Israel just assumes the whole world hates them bc of antisemitism and there is no point. Possibly a huge error on their part.

Most of the time it can be easily countered with history and facts but no one will believe or listen to any of it half the time. People just see a spicy title on Instagram and decide to repost without doing any research or knowing any sort of history of either side…

For example when Israel sent the warning to Gaza to evacuate certain areas DAYS in advance to any military intervention. Hamas was playing dirty, there is phone call evidence that Hamas was blockading their own people from escaping and now everyone is blaming Israel for it being their fault civilians are dying when it’s really Hamas killing its own people to make Israel look bad. Also it’s known that Hamas has tunnels and hides out in hospitals and such to make Israel look even worse when they get attacked… This is how Hamas will win the hearts of these Americans and Canadians through the media.

nhjxe0,How do you kick Hamas out of power in Gaza?,"Not enough people are asking this question.

Twenty years of Hamas rule has been a disaster in Gaza and in Israel. Hamas kills and brutalizes their own people, they commit endless war crimes that leave their people under a regional blockade, [they are a billion dollar organization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinternational/2018/01/24/the-richest-terror-organizations-in-the-world/?sh=2390a1ac7fd1) with the ability to develop Gaza into a decent region with a good quality of life for its citizens, but instead they choose to destroy, to store rocket launchers in hospitals, to commit thousands of war crimes a year, to kill their political opponents and allow the situation for the people of Gaza to devolve into squalor because Hamas cares more about killing the Jews than about treating their own population with the human rights and dignity they deserve. They support Iranian terror and they are well-supplied with thousands of rockets and antitank missiles. The longer they stay entrenched in power, the stronger they get.

It's clear the people of Gaza cannot remove Hamas on their own. Hamas rules Gaza with an iron fist and kills anyone who tries to change the status quo.

Hamas can only be removed from outside. As we saw when USA removed Hussain and Ghaddafi, removing shitty dictators can result in years or decades of instability. Is the solution for Israel to give Gazans Israeli citizenship? Should Israel stage a ground invasion - no one else on Earth will do it - remove Hamas from power, and then spend the next few years doing what Hamas failed to do, develop Gaza into a place with schools and hospitals and businesses and gardens and tech industries where people there will have a good quality of life, open borders and no blockade?

Hamas needs to go. They need to be removed from power. The world is blaming Israel for Hamas's war crimes and Hamas's death count. They fire rockets whenever they want, they are war criminals, they have failed as a government of Gaza. Maybe they've succeeded in their goal of creating problems for Israelis and Palestinians, but they've failed in the goal of actually turning Israel and Palestine into decent places for their citizens to live.

t1gic4,An increasingly large minority of redditors are hiding their antisemitism behind criticism of Israel,"A post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/t13yes/israelis_protest_against_russian_occupation_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on r/Damnthatsinteresting has me worried. The video depicts Israeli citizens protesting against the invasion of Ukraine, and the response by redditors is overwhelmingly antisemitic. We see this more and more as time goes on. 

On any topic regarding Israel/Palestine, it is easy to find the statement “anti-Israel (government) is not antisemitism.” I completely agreed with this sentiment. Criticism of a government is a healthy aspect of democracy. However, what I once believed to ring true now isn’t so clear anymore. Is anti-Israel and anti-Zionism truly separate from antisemitism? Or have antisemites blurred the line beyond repair by hijacking a fair belief?

In the post about Israelis protesting Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, there are calls of “irony” and “hypocrisy” alongside hateful rhetoric directed at Israeli civilians. Where the real irony and hypocrisy lies is within these comments. The same people who cry that criticism of the Israeli government is not antisemitism are showing that they themselves cannot differentiate between the two. None of these commenters know the stance of those individuals protesting. They could very well be part of a supportive Jewish demographic for Palestinian equality. Yet, redditors will demonize these people all the same for being born an Israeli. For existing. And dare I say, for being Jewish. 

Antisemitism isn’t the same antisemitism that we used to know. It has evolved to be more accepted by those who are not privy to its history. Accepted by those who come from good intentions. It has overtaken a movement for peace and equality, merging it with that of hatred and bigotry. And it all hides behind a word and belief that has been weaponized; “Zionism.”

Anti-Zionism has become the new antisemitism that bigots use to conceal their intentions as it is unacceptable to say “f Jews.” “F Zionists,” on the other hand, is met with approval among those who view the Israeli government as evil. Lo and behold, antisemites have a new group where they can voice their opinions without being shunned. They have found a home in the Western liberal left. 

Jews can no longer trust at face value that criticism of Israel is just that, the criticism of a government. Zionism, in which the meaning derives from that of self-determination and a state for Jews, has now been charged and equated to oppression and discrimination. Jews are attacked worldwide whenever the Israel/Palestinian conflict heats up under the guise of “supporting Palestinians” and opposing a fascist regime.  

So, no. Criticism of Israel is no longer separate from antisemitism in many cases now unfortunately as the backlash towards Israelis protesting the invasion of Ukraine shows.

When hamas Launched October 7th attack. They knew that Israel would retaliate "," 
When hamas Launched October 7th attack. They knew that Israel would retaliate and they hide under the city in one of the most populated areas in the world
Hamas  has three war experience with Israel and they know that civilians would die, many of them would die. 

And they like it because this is how they can provoke Israel. And Drag israel  into a dirty war. 
Where they will get legitimacy, more power and Israel would get , strained by children's blood. And I say, in this situation, The Hamas Is the responsible and the only responsible for the Bloodshed in Gaza.

There are civilian casualties.
But their blood is on the hands of Hamas, and on the hands of Hamas alone. 
Because Israel warned the civilians in Gaza to evacuate. 
And give them 21 days to escape. 
But they still insist on staying to give Hamas cover. You know why? 

Beccaue Unfortunately, many Gazans voted for Hamas,support hamas, and the vast majority of Gazans hate Israel.
And many choose to be silent. 

But when the majority of the Arab world, not only the gazans, failed to condemn Hamas and say that this does not represent the Arab people. 
They failed to condemn Hamas. This is their biggest mistake. And when such a society, fail their moral responsibility; at least I don't want to say to eradicate Hamas. But at least morally, to take a moral responsibility and say, We are different. This does not represent our religion or our culture. But instead, they gave Hamas cover, and they failed to condemn Hamas. This is their problem. So Israel is left with no other choice but to defend itself.
And it's tragic to see any loss of life.

and all the victims of Gaza that you see. Remember my words. They are war victims(12k of them are hamas).
Very different type of victims than October 7 victims. On October 7th victims were victims of genocide.
This is the highest crime that can be committed. A genocide. 

Where you systematically kill people, hamas moved from door to door. And Anyhilating everything that was in their  way. This is what Hamas did. Indiscriminately.
And What's happening in Gaza? Israel called The people say to evacuate this building or dropping evacuation leaflets. because they know there is a tunnel under it.

Then hamas They are going with their propaganda, using pictures and videos from Syria to say, Look what Israel is doing to us. While they are the ones hijacking, an entire society is using Palestinians as human shields and taking their humanitarian aid that Israel is allowing,This is the devil in action. 
So, of course, there's no other way but the use of force against a terrorist organization.

 when majority of people agree on violence, validate violence. Justify genocide. And think it's a point of view. To become a Nazi. On this day, It all begins with killing Jews. This is what happened last century. And nazism Many thought of it as a point of view. And now history is repeating itself. And even in the middle of our Educational institutions, we've been invaded with Hamas ideology by the name of ""palestine"" ,Anti-Semitism is now rebranded as anti-Zionism, and it is the new Nazism. and it should be rejected on campuses and should be rejected everywhere in the United States. 

The USA should be the last country to allow this type of mentality. 
To express itself, because Nazism is not a point of view. It is not. 

And I will never validate savages. 
So basically, Israel had no other choice but to use force, and war is ugly and in war people die. This is why Hamas should not have started this war from the beginning. They dragged all of us along Into this situation.
because they started this war and war is ugly. People die in war. If Israel was not very careful. There would be a lot more people dead. 

But what I know for sure. 
Is that Israel will end this war; whatever it takes, they have to eradicate hamas. 
For a better future for the Palestinians and for the Israelis.

At some point, the two sides in this conflict must accept the realities on the ground. Throughout history, there have been wars lost, national borders changed and refugees in motion. This refugee problem would go away if the refugees were accepted by Arab countries. But will NEVER go away if there are parties paying for terroristic activities (Hamas) and maintaining and teaching new generations to hate Jews.

As for Israel, STOP the settlements! Enough! The orthodox Jews that are radical pushing for the expansion of the settlements are NO friend to Peace. They are an outrage and a cynical attempt to make it nearly impossible to incorporate these settlements in a future two state solution.

1binybj,WHY IS THE ARAB WORLD DOING NOTHING???,"20% of Israel's population are Palestinian-Israeli citizens with full Israeli rights (a higher proportion of the population than any minority in the USA). Israel have historically been the most committed nation in the world to providing resources, employment, and refuge to Palestinians.

**Meanwhile the surrounding Arab nations continue to force Palestinians to exist in perpetuity as disenfranchised refugee populations for longer than any other group in modern history (75 years).**

How come there aren't millions of Muslims and Palestinian allies crowding the streets every single day with signs calling for Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Iran, or any of the other 50+ Islamic nations on the planet to take in Gazan refugees en masse? Or even to naturalize their current Palestinian refugee populations? Why is it that **the violent destruction of Israel and its people** is preferable to the **peaceful resettlement of Palestinians** into the surrounding nations that claim to be the close allies of Palestinians? Seriously ask yourself that question.

I reckon the Arab nations don't want peace, they want to perpetuate this conflict until a time where Israel may happen to be weak enough to fall. I certainly don't think they care about Palestinian lives, not even the tiniest bit. Hell, we already know Hamas doesn't give two shits about Palestinian lives but their own.

17ye2z4,I'm tired,"I live in Israel, but I've never really *felt* Israeli if that makes sense. I've never aligned with the culture, and I just didn't feel like a part of my country.

But all that changed ~~when the Fire Nation attacked~~ after October 7th. When Hamas broke in and massacred more than 1,000 people, torturing, burning, and raping them. At first, this only solidified the feeling of ""Why am I even here?"", I live in a country constantly under threat, that I don't feel like I belong to, so why?

It became very clear the second I opened social media. Mind you, this was Oct 7-8, before Israel began to retaliate. I saw people saying ""This is what resistance looks like"", people denying it and asking for proof **of women being raped**, and people showing support, for terrorists who entered a music festival and killed everyone they could.

Over the last month, this has gotten worse. I see anti-semitism every time I open social media, I see people call Israel genocidal, demanding we stop the war without an ounce of thought to the implications of doing that. I see people ripping posters of innocent children who were kidnapped while saying they care about innocent lives.

Although the majority of people doing those things aren't anti-semitic, the loud voices are, and the people who support them don't really understand what is happening and don't understand what they are supporting.

I'm tired of feeling unsafe. I'm tired of having to look at the time before I go out of the house to make sure I'm not stuck outside when there's an alarm. I'm tired of being stuck in a choice between anti-semitism outside of Israel, and Hamas in Israel. I'm tired of people thinking they know what war is when they never had to run into a safe room since they were 6 years old.

Before all the pro-Palestine crowd goes to say ""Well the children there feel unsafe too/are dead"", I know. I know they do, but the reality is that if Israel didn't defend itself properly, not 11,000 people would be dead, but all 9 million. When Hamas broke in, they didn't distinguish between civilians and soldiers. They didn't distinguish between children and adults. They killed everyone they could.

*“We can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children."" - Golda Meir*

I'm tired of this war. I'm tired of the anti-semitism. I'm tired of the violence. I'm tired of people who don't understand the situation. I'm tired of extremism. I'm tired of far-right Israelis.

#""They teach the children there that Israel needs to be destroyed"": the most powerful economic body in Gaza after Hamas

**With a budget of more than a billion dollars a year, control over half of the schools in Gaza and the conduct of an extraterritory, the UNRWA agency has become the most powerful economic body in the Gaza Strip after Hamas - and it has a significant role in the current situation**

Dalal Al Moghrabi was a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon who commanded one of the deadliest and most memorable suicide attacks in the country's history - the 1978 ""Bloody Bus"" attack on the coastal road, in which 35 Israelis were murdered. El Moghrabi is also a Palestinian national hero, a role model who is presented as a martyred saint who sacrificed herself on the altar of resistance to the occupation. Her name is commemorated in rallies, the names of schools and squares - and the attack she commanded is presented as a national heroic story in Palestinian Authority textbooks as well. Despite much criticism of the incitement in the PA's textbooks in recent years, only five years ago an entire chapter was added to them on El Mughrabi, which is defined in it as ""the martyr who recorded in her struggle one of the images of heroism, and is therefore remembered forever in our hearts and minds.""

These textbooks are also used in the schools of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (or UNRWA for short) that operate in the territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. UNRWA operates more than 700 schools in Palestinian refugee camps around the world, of which 284 schools are in Gaza alone - where more than half of the children of the Gaza Strip study.

Since the October 7th massacre, more stories are revealed almost every day about the close connection between Hamas and UNRWA and its institutions in the Gaza Strip - from the identification and open and extensive support on social networks of UNRWA employees and students who were educated in the organization in the actions of Hamas, to the involvement of some of them in terrorism itself.

Last week, for example, the journalist Almog Booker published that one of the returned Israeli abductees was kept in the home of a UNRWA teacher, a father of ten children who hardly provided her with food and medicine (UNRWA responded by accusing Booker of spreading an unfounded claim and demanding proof. Booker replied that he did not can reveal the identity of the abductee and called on the organization to investigate the matter). In addition, the IDF spokesman revealed that dozens of rockets and other weapons were found under UNRWA boxes in private homes in the north of the Gaza Strip, and research institutes that have been following the organization for many years discovered that many of the Nuhaba terrorists (the elite Hamas unit that led the massacre) and Other Hamas who carried out the massacre are graduates of UNRWA schools, or employees of the organization. One of the senior terrorists killed in the fighting in Gaza, Hamas' Minister of Economy, Jawad Abu Shamala, was even a teacher at a UNRWA school in Khan Yunis.

[Weapons found under UNRWA boxes in Gaza](https://twitter.com/bokeralmog/status/1730928749481242797)

Another teacher of UNRWA in Gaza, Sara Al-Dirawi, posted on her Facebook on the day of the massacre a video in which Hamas terrorists are seen roaming the streets of Israel with guns drawn and shooting at Israeli cars, and attached to the video a verse from the Koran that encourages the actions: ""We will attack them in battalions that cannot stand However, it seems that all of these are just points on the continuum in an issue much larger than one textbook or another - how UNRWA, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, became an organization that many see as a key player in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which serves the factors that are not interested in seeing it resolved.

#From 700,000 refugees to 5.9 million

There is nothing routine about the existence and activities of UNRWA. The agency was established in 1949 following the War of Independence, with the aim of providing shelter, relief and health services to the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees from the war. A year later, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was established, whose aim is to take care refugees in the world, but under pressure from the Arab countries, the Palestinian refugees remain under the responsibility of UNRWA - which remains to this day the only refugee agency in the world dedicated to a specific refugee population.

Dr. Einat Wilf, former member of the Knesset and author of the book ""The War of the Right of Return"" together with Adi Schwartz, has been devoting the last few years to activities around the world on the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and UNRWA's part in it. ""UNRWA was established as a temporary agency because the UN Refugee Agency then concentrated mainly on refugees from Europe. There were approximately 700,000 Arab refugees (then they were not yet called Palestinians) from the war,The assumption was that UNRWA would take care of them through relief and employment in cooperation with the host countries, resettle them all and close down three or four years later, as happened with the temporary agency that was set up at the same time to take care of the Korean refugees after World War II."" But unlike the Korean case, in the Middle East the matter got complicated. ""The Palestinian refugees themselves refused to be absorbed into the new states, because they understood that it would mean that they lost the war, and they are not ready to accept that to this day.""Wilf explains.

And not only the refugees themselves refused, the host Arab countries also refused to integrate them into the content, because the so-called absorption constitutes an agreement with the results of the war and is against the refugees' right to return to Israel.

According to Wilf, at the beginning, UNRWA had good intentions. ""There were budgets, good people, employment projects, the people of the American New Deal came here (the American plan from the 1930s for reconstruction and getting out of the crisis after the Great Depression) - it was their idea, that the Arab refugees will engage in development work in the Arab world.""

If the mission of a refugee agency is to settle them and end their refugee status - UNRWA has failed miserably in this. Over the years, there have been changes and simplifications in accepting refugee status and in the eligibility of the descendants of Palestinian refugees to receive services from UNRWA. If at first refugees were considered only those who lost their home and livelihood as a result of the 1948 war, and then the definition was extended to include their children, from 1982 the eligibility for the refugee definition was also extended to their descendants for all future generations. That is, a great-grandson of a refugee and his own children will also be considered refugees themselves.

In addition, contrary to the rules that apply to other refugees in the world, in the case of UNRWA and the Palestinians, even those who receive citizenship from another country are still considered Palestinian refugees. Thus, most of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan are considered Jordanian citizens and refugees according to UNRWA - they live in its refugee camps , receive services from her, and at the same time can work at any job, vote and more. In addition, according to UNRWA rules, even a person who is involved in terrorist activity or war crimes does not lose his status as a refugee.

As a result, in more than 70 years of its existence, the population of its beneficiaries has grown from 700,000 refugees on the eve of the establishment of the State of Israel to 5.9 million, as of 2022. Of these, 1.6 million people are in Gaza - a fourth generation of refugees, which is largely perpetuated through UNRWA's eligibility system.

With the increase in the number of refugees, UNRWA has become a body that generates more than a billion dollars a year (an amount that increases and goes according to the increase in the number of refugees) and a huge part of the educational, medical and welfare system of the Palestinians. It operates in 58 refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Jordan , in Lebanon and Syria, and provides them with the services of clinics and medical treatment, food and clothing assistance, welfare services, financial financial assistance of loans and assistance to small businesses, and infrastructure projects in the refugee camps.

However, while it is difficult to dispute the importance of providing medical aid or food to those in need, this is not the case when it comes to the highlight of UNRWA - the field of education. About 60% of its budget is directed in this direction. According to Wilf, ""the Western perception holds that we throw the money at UNRWA"" And if it doesn't help - it won't hurt. But this is a mistake because UNRWA, and especially its schools, has a dramatic role in turning the Palestinians into a people that exists in refugee camps separate from the host countries - and its organizing idea is the right of return and the denial of the Jewish state.""

#""The PA's curriculum - the worst in the Sunni world""
Indeed, it is impossible to talk about UNRWA without talking about its schools - and especially about the content taught there.""The education system is the thing that most influences a society's consciousness and ethos. And what the children are taught in the Palestinian education system - most of whom attend UNRWA schools - is that Israel is an amorphous thing, not even a state, a Zionist entity, and needs to be destroyed,"" explains Sharona Shir Zablodovsky, a member of the Deborah Forum and an expert in public policy, who until recently was engaged in policy promotion at the Middle East Policy Research Center. ""The goal of the education system is not to discuss the 1967 borders, but to return to the situation before 1948. The children say this explicitly. It's a society in waiting.""

More than half a million students study in schools in the Gaza Strip, more than half of them in schools operated by UNRWA. Many more study in UNRWA schools in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Marcus Sheff, CEO of the international research and policy institute IMPACT-se, which investigates and analyzes the content of textbooks in the world, has devoted many years to researching the textbooks in these schools, and the reports issued by the organization repeatedly show how UNRWA's educational materials incite violence, glorify Martyrs and suicide attacks, demonize Israel and promote antisemitism.

In one of the videos, for example, children from different UNRWA schools in the Shoafat and Kalandia refugee camps are interviewed. When they are asked what they learn in school, the answers are shocking. ""We are taught that the Zionists are our enemies and we must fight them,"" says a 12-year-old boy, ""that the Jews are terrorists , that they are bad, that they murdered our children."" A 7-year-old boy says: ""I am ready to stab a Jew and run them over. I will fight, I will drive into you with a car. We must stab them again and again, run them over and shoot them."" Another boy says: ""Stabbing and running over Jews brings honor to the Palestinians. I intend to stab them with knives."" A 6-year-old girl says: ""People love Palestine and are ready to die for it. I want to fight against them (the Jews) and defeat them.""

[Students in UNRWA schools operating in the Shoafat and Kalandiya refugee camps](https://twitter.com/QuantumFlux36/status/1724491087392411684)

According to Sheff,""The curriculum of the Palestinian Authority is the worst in the Sunni world. We know what is on every page of every textbook of 12 or more countries in the Middle East, and while all the important Sunni countries have been improving their textbooks in recent years - only in the Palestinian Authority is it the other way around. They did A reform of the textbooks in 2014-2016 and the result is a curriculum without any mention of the possibility of peace with Israel, with anti-Semitism, enthusiasm for violence, examples that jihad is the most important thing in life, that death is better than life, that it is good to slit the throat of the enemy"".

**What happened then that made them escalate the tone?**

Chef: ""It is very difficult to explain why and how, but it came from above Ramallah and was liked by Hamas, so it turns out that there is no rift between Fatah and Hamas on the issue of textbooks. The PA, Hamas and UNRWA all teach the same books that incite violence and terrorism, and there is no such thing as Israel.""

**Are there also actual studies with value?**

Chef: ""There are core studies, but even there this is embedded. Jihad messages are integrated into 'neutral' content, such as mathematical problems or language studies. The textbooks can educate the society of the future we want to live in, as is currently the case in Egypt, Saudi Arabia And in Morocco, who decided to improve their society through education for moderation and peace, or to turn education into a strategic tool for violence and raise a young generation of martyrs. We warned for years that if we continued to fund UNRWA, without telling them to teach something else, there would be a disaster. And here, the disaster happened.""

#Following global criticism - access to materials on the site were restricted

In recent years, it seemed that there had been a turning point in the attitude of the Western countries to UNRWA. The most dramatic step was in 2018, when the Trump administration decided to stop the large amount of money that the US pours into UNRWA - hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It did so as a result of the growing number of those who receive refugee status, and accordingly increasing US spending and perpetuating the Palestinian exodus.

Specifically in Israel they were not enthusiastic about the move. Although they spoke loudly in condemnation of the organization, behind the scenes they worked to soften the blow (to UNRWA): according to news published in the media at the time, the security establishment warned the political echelon that the West Bank and Gaza depended for their livelihood on UNRWA's aid to the refugee camps, that the cut could deteriorate the economy, especially in Gaza, and cause Hamas to become stronger, and warned that UNRWA was preparing to fire thousands of teachers - which could affect the behavior of the youth in the refugee camps and increase friction with the IDF forces. If this reminds anyone of the problem of the Israeli leadership's ""addiction to silence"" - he is not alone.

""Israel fought tooth and nail against the decision and only when it realized that Trump was determined, it 'blessed' him - and immediately wanted Germany to ask that it increase funding to compensate for the lack of funding. Since then, Germany has been UNRWA's second largest funder,"" says Wilf. Indeed, following the US announcement ""B, the German government decided to significantly increase aid to UNRWA, and called on other European countries to do the same, claiming that ""the loss of the organization could cause an uncontrollable chain reaction"".

But UNRWA's troubles did not end here: around the same time, in 2019, the organization became embroiled in a major corruption case, when an internal investigation led by the United Nations revealed findings of corruption, nepotism and sexual harassment at the top of the organization. Among other things, it is claimed that the organization's secretary general at the time, the Swiss Pierre Karnabul, appointed Maria Mohammadi, with whom he had an intimate relationship, to a senior position in the organization at a salary of $200,000 a year, and that the two led a life of luxury at the organization's expense. Karnabul resigned, and two other senior members of the organization They also left amid allegations of corruption. Karnabul was replaced by Philip Lazarini, who still holds the position to this day. It is possible that publications like this are behind the anger that exists among residents of Gaza towards the organization. ""For me, UNRWA is a company that works for profit. Not a relief agency.

A company with a fleet of cars whose executives make a lot of money. They are the ones who actually control Gaza, and not from now on,"" claims a Gazan businessman who is currently in Gaza.

In 2021, measures against UNRWA were intensified by its major donors, amid new revelations about the incitement and violent content in its textbooks: the governments of Australia and Canada opened investigations against the agency, Britain confirmed that UNRWA had indeed produced and distributed inciting educational materials. In response, UNRWA closed free access to materials that had appeared on its website until then. Shortly thereafter, in April 2021, the European Parliament issued a strong condemnation against UNRWA for using educational materials that incite hatred and violence against Israel and the Jews—and conditioned continued funding to the agency in the adaptation of the educational materials to the UN values ​​of peace and tolerance. Lazarini had to admit in a poignant debate held in the European Parliament in September of that year the fact that the contents of the agency's schools include anti-Semitism, incitement to violence and the glorification of acts of terrorism. A few months later UNRWA was also presented with the bill : In May 2022, the EU announced that it would cut 40% of its funding budget, Britain cut funding by more than half, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also cut their funding to the agency by tens of percent.

In the US, meanwhile, the administration changed, and announced that it would resume aid to UNRWA in the amount of 150 million dollars that Trump stopped, but set a series of conditions for the transfer of the money. These include a commitment that the organization will maintain neutrality, prevent the introduction of weapons and improper use of its facilities, and especially work to prevent incitement in textbooks.

[US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, with UNRWA Secretary General Philip Lazzarini, at a meeting in Amman about a month ago](https://imgur.com/a/wPphhg4)

A quick look at UNRWA's budget shows that it still exceeds a billion dollars a year. Although in 2020 the budget dropped slightly to 940 million dollars, it rose again in 2021 and 2022 to 1.2 billion each year - and the contents? Recent studies They show that the situation is only getting worse, including on social media, where words of praise and exuberant joy from UNRWA teachers about the October 7th massacre were found.

**Why do the governments continue to fund UNRWA despite the knowledge of the major problems in the organization and the content it instills in generations of Palestinian children?**

Wilf: ""It's a kind of inertia.When I meet with senior officials in these countries, they tell me: The State of Israel is asking, the Palestinians are asking, why can't we give? They feel they are contributing to the Middle East. And I know how to knock down all of UNRWA's arguments except for one - which the Israeli government is asking for.""

**A bit reminiscent of the silver suitcases from Qatar.**

Wilf: ""It's even worse, because it's under the umbrella of the UN and world peace. It gives even more legitimacy.""

According to many, UNRWA's conduct makes the organization a significant negative player in the conflict that has been bleeding here for 75 years. ""UNRWA is one of the weights on the political process and on the ability to reach an end to the conflict and lawsuits,"" claims Yonatan Adiri, a high-tech entrepreneur and former army liaison officer to the Cross Red and former president Shimon Peres' adviser. ""Let's take as an example a 20-year-old young man who was born in a refugee camp in Lebanon - he is considered a Palestinian refugee, he does not have a passport like a Lebanese citizen and he has limitations such as jobs he cannot fill. All he hears is that one day he will have the right to return to Palestine, that is, to Jaffa, to Haifa , to Lod or Acre. For him, the 1948 war and the evacuations will end only when Israel is wiped off the map. The most significant symbol in Palestinian society is the key. At Abu Mazen's meeting with Blinken last month, Abu Mazen wore a pin in the shape of a large key on his lapel. This is a deep ethos. It was fine If it was about 700,000 refugees who are getting older and dwindling, but not when their number is only increasing.""

Adiri mentions the statement of Musa Abu Marzouk, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, in an interview a month ago with the RT network in Arabic, according to which the tunnels built in Gaza were intended to protect Hamas and not the residents of the Gaza Strip, and that ""everyone knows that 75% of the residents of the Gaza Strip are refugees"" and that ""It is the responsibility of the UN to protect them."" According to Adiri, ""the fact that UNRWA operates under the UN has created for Hamas the possibility to go with and feel without - although I am the ruler here, but I have no state responsibility because they are all refugees and receive funds from the West. At the elementary level - UNRWA is like an addictive drug that prevents the Palestinians from taking responsibility for themselves.""

[Musa Abu Marzouk, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, says in an interview with the RT network in Arabic that the tunnels are intended to protect the terrorist organization and not the residents of the Gaza Strip](https://twitter.com/KhalilAsslan/status/1719293494991216675)

Wilf emphasizes that ""UNRWA exists as a kind of ex-territory to the United Nations - it is not a body of the United Nations and does not have a United Nations budget, but instead receives money from donor countries. The General Assembly renews its mandate once every three years, but beyond Therefore, the UN does not take responsibility for the contents. UNRWA today is essentially a Palestinian organization. It does maintain the image of the UN and Western funding, but it is an organization where almost all of its employees are Palestinians (99% of them; RL), and until the establishment of the PA it was the largest employer of Palestinians. When you hear that UNRWA workers were killed in Gaza - everyone imagines 80 Norwegians who were killed, but they are all Palestinians who were born in Gaza, who in their minds are refugees who will one day return to their home. The whole image is wrong.""

#""We give money here to children who will have no future""

Is the massacre, the war and the shock that the world is going through these days an opportunity to change the paradigm when it comes to UNRWA? ""I wish. I hope so, because otherwise it really is to continue the conflict forever,"" asserts Wilf. ""For years I would go to UNRWA's funding countries and tell them, look, you are sitting here in Brussels and Berlin and feel so good and believe that you are people of peace - and we Israelis will pay for it With blood. They are funding another generation and another generation of Palestinians, whose holy goal is to liberate Palestine from the river to the sea. Only now are people suddenly asking themselves how we got to this situation.""

**And suppose the West stops funding, everything is resolved? Or could such a scenario be dangerous?**

Wilf: ""It's not just to stop the money. The goal is to tell them why we're doing this. To tell them, look friends, you're not refugees, Gaza is your home. The West Bank, where you are - you stay. Build your future, stop thinking that you will be Return and that you liberate Palestine. As long as this is your worldview - we are not with you. The day you tell us that you understand that you are not refugees and recognize the Jewish people's right to self-determination and want to live alongside the State of Israel - we will give you ten times more. But until then we will not continue to finance the ideology Yours, which is all built on the denial of Israel's existence.

""October 7th is a defining moment, because the world realized that the large amount of money poured in did not buy peace - but created a greater disaster. And whoever says, if there is no money, a disaster will happen, then we ask - how much more disaster can there be?""

**Aren't we making life easy for ourselves when we blame UNRWA for hating Israel - and not the occupation itself?**

Wilf: ""I wish it was that. It would have made life easier and the solution was simple - ending the occupation. Unfortunately, there is a reversal of cause and effect here. They reject any peace settlement that would end the occupation because they insist on 'return'. They do not see Gaza their permanent place"".

**In your opinion, the occupation and settlements have no weight in the hatred that generations of Palestinians feel towards us?**

Wilf: ""For them, the goal was and remains that the Jews will not have a state. Therefore, Israel can be in the West Bank or leave it, be in Gaza or leave it, build the settlements or dismantle the settlements. For the Palestinians, the meaning of these steps is zero to the question of whether it increases or decreases Their willingness to accept its existence.""

According to Shir Zablodovsky, ""What needs to be done with UNRWA is not to close the organization, but to merge it with the United Nations General Refugee Agency. The West needs to understand that if an organization is supposed to take care of the rehabilitation of refugees, but its schools are full of weapons and educate children with them To the credit of return and jihad - they are building the next war.

""From the point of view of the Western world, there is a humanitarian failure here, because the countries that donate money make children want to commit suicide. If the West really cares about the Palestinian children, then maybe they should stop this. Money is given here to children who will have no future. If the people had a free choice, they probably wouldn't They would choose to be martyrs, but you are born into it and everything that is pumped into you from childhood is not how to improve your life, but how to hurt others in order to achieve redemption. And if you want to change that, you have to take care of the infrastructure.""

Sheff claims that ""the world needs to understand now that the UNRWA schools cannot continue to teach hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children about a Palestine from the river to the sea that will be achieved through self-sacrifice and jihad, and that Jews are inhuman and that there is no such thing as the State of Israel - and that a disaster will not happen. Donors need to understand that UNRWA has failed in its main mission - humane education. If this is not stopped now - we will repeatedly receive hate studies that lead to what we saw on October 7. 3,000 rapists, murderers, corpse burners - this is behavior that hate education creates and humane education is supposed to prevent . There is a moral obligation towards these children - not to turn them into suicide terrorists; and a moral obligation to the Israelis - not to allow them to become the victims of Jihad. If ever there was a moment when the world should say Khalas - this is the moment. With such large budgets also comes responsibility.""

If Hamas is the new government, what does that mean for the millions of Jews (1/2 of the worlds Jewish population) that live there?
Hamas has made it very clear that their objective is to murder all the Jews. Does “from the river to the sea” mean ethnically cleansing Jews from these areas? Where are Jews supposed to go?

This despite Hamas clearly using it for military purposes. Among what was found:

gf34wp,Israelis should be more critical of Israel,"As an Israeli, I totally get why the natural instinct is to defend Israel, especially in an international context. Israel obviously gets a lot of unwarranted flak.

However, I think this ""call to arms"" to defend us from slander is also working to dull our senses with regards to justified criticism.

For example, it is completely within reason to acknowledge the legitimacy of claims about unjustified violations of human rights in the West Bank. You don't have to agree with that claim. By all means, if you believe that all violations of human right are justifiable and necessary, and that you can defend that position, go ahead. However, it seems to me more often than not, that people automatically assume that this position could only be made from a misinformed point of view, and are usually greeted with empty blanket statements such as ""Israel has a right to defend itself"" without going into the hard questions: are those violations promoting the defend of Israel? What would be the consequences of less belligerent policies? etc. (and not to mention the extremely common whataboutisms such as ""Arab countries treat Palestinians worse"", ""they celebrate in the streets when Jews are murdered"" etc.)

The whole point of this sub, as I see it, is to get our hands dirty with the often overlooked details, and to have a mutually respectful discussion in which all sides are willing to reconsider any of their positions, however painful our experiences are when these positions are usually challenged. This is the only way to leave the prejudices and dictated narratives instilled into us by the perpetuating conflict, and start a healing process. It should be that even people with an inclination to the right could be critical of Israel's policies in Gaza and WB without being considered (implicitly or explicitly) traitorous. 

This has to happen on both sides, but I can only speak about what happens in the Israeli dialogue, as it is the only one I know. The point is that **it doesn't matter**. Like all other things, criticisms of Israel should be considered at face value, not by how much it could also be applied to Palestine, Syria or anyone else.

As a side note, [here is an example](https://idanlandau.com/2011/06/25/towards-arab-free-jordan-valley/) (in Hebrew, unfortunately) of a very harsh criticism of Israel which affected my views dearly, and to which I have never seen an appropriate response.",07/05/20 09:08:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/gf34wp/israelis_should_be_more_critical_of_israel/,152,40,398,Israeli,top,all

18ljy8p,"“Palestinians” only goal was to kill, kill and kill.","A few days ago I watched for the second time the painful video of more than 40 minutes of original material from the 7/10 massacre.

I share some of my thoughts:
🔴 ""Allahu Akbar.""
In the video you hear that phrase dozens or perhaps hundreds of times. While they are beheading people, while they shoot at random, while they kidnap, while they massacre, while naked corpses are paraded.
Their slogan is their ""faith"" in the ""divine"" mission to kill Jews.
It is not a political issue, it does not change if the border passes 100 meters further away or further here.
Extremist hatred is ingrained to the point that they can believe that Allah is happy while they commit such atrocities.
Who else shouts ""Allahu Akbar""?
ALL Islamic terrorists.
Yes, those who blow themselves up in Paris, those who run over in Barcelona or those who shoot people in Brussels. And there are no ""territorial disputes"" or ""occupation.""
Because the simple truth is that this is not about land or occupation, this is about Islamic extremism.
Because of the massive indoctrination that makes them believe that the other has no right to live if they do not adapt to your customs.
Worse still, they have a divine order to kill them.

🔴 In fact, before watching the video I decided to try to listen more carefully. At some point, before beheading someone or shooting someone, did these ruthless terrorists say that they were doing it to liberate Palestine?
The answer is NO.
“Palestinians” only goal was to kill, kill and kill.
They don't care about ""liberating Palestine.""
What's more, I didn't even hear the word Palestine for more than 40 minutes.
What they care about is murdering Jews.
The more, the better.

🔴 Perhaps the most difficult thing about watching this video is that while one has tears in one's eyes and one's heart is in pieces, one can see joy on the screen.
Pure joy.
Pure joy while they murder.
In what is probably the most shocking image in the video, a Hamas terrorist is seen decapitating a dead Israeli soldier and taking his head (while still wearing his helmet).
And his smile is total.
In another scene you hear a terrorist call his parents, proudly telling him that he killed 10 Jews.
And in other scenes, MANY, terrorists and Gaza civilians are seen celebrating with shouts, songs and joy when they see dead Israelis, whether men or women, soldiers or civilians.
The world celebrates when the local team brings home the long-awaited trophy.
In Gaza WE ARE THE TROPHY.
Our women, our parents, our brothers.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY.

🔴 Violations.
Fortunately they did not publish images of the ruthless terrorists raping women.
But young women with bloody genitals are clearly seen on several occasions.
It doesn't take a genius to understand that they were most likely raped or at least raped and mutilated.

🔴 Watching the video a second time made me reflect on the stages of anti-Israel propaganda.
At first some celebrated openly, others remained silent (perhaps some even ashamed that their ""heroes"" could commit such atrocities).
Then they began to deny the massacre (""Hamas only killed soldiers"").
They also started trying to shift the blame onto Israel (from the disgusting ""Israel let this happen"" to the manipulative ""Israel killed some of the civilians"").
But we must not allow the cheap, lying and disgusting propaganda of these people who celebrate death to blind us to reality.
Hamas invaded Israel. Hamas systematically murdered innocent people.
They threw grenades at bomb shelters. They shot at people who were trying to escape. They massacred people who were innocently traveling by car in the south. They executed elderly people in their living rooms. They shot bathroom by bathroom at the music festival to make sure no one survived. They entered a daycare on a Kibbutz (probably trying to murder or kidnap children) and ended up shooting a woman who was hiding there.
I SAW all that.
They didn't tell me, I saw it with my eyes.

And my last thought is very simple.
🔴 THIS CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN.
Hamas does not regret what it did. What's more, they keep saying they would do it again.
A few minutes ago they even published a video boasting that Israel was late in discovering the massive tunnel they are building near the Erez crossing and accompanied it with the message ""the mission is now completed"", with videos from the day they kidnapped and murdered our loved ones.
So Israel's commitment must be simple: not stop until this cannot happen again.
The State of Israel failed its citizens on 7/10 when it failed to protect them. They failed his citizens many times before when they heard the world asking him to cease fire and leave Hamas alive, instead of ending the threat.
But we learned the painful lesson.

177ozzb,calling to 'decolonize' israel makes no sense,"I have seen that a lot of the discourse surrounding the current war uses the argument that Israel is a colonial state and that decolonization is always violent, or that colonization is inherently violent so violent decolonization is justified, or just generally that a colonial state is an imposition on the region and is unjust and illegitimate.

I think this idea that Israel is 'colonizing' at all is kind of a weak claim. Colonies are overseas settlement projects of domestic empires (british, french, spanish), and I can not think of any Jewish empire that has existed in history, nor even a strong centralized base for the Jews to have launched their colony from. 

Also, I think there is a massive implication in the word 'decolonize' which is that the colonizers go home, that they have somewhere to return to. Where would the jews in Israel go? what is there home? Yes, many came from European countries, but the notion that they traveled from these countries to go to Israel ignores something very key: they *fled* those European countries, because after the diaspora despite settling in many places, there was never a place in history the Jews went where they werent persecuted, ostracized, oppressed, or murdered, and so when they left these countries to go to the region of Palestine, where their ancestral, historical home was as a people, it was not much of a choice. and this is not to mention that the other, non European jews in Israel came from the surrounding middle eastern countries, but they did not just 'come' but fled those countries' pogroms as well. Where do the Israelis go back to when they 'decolonize' israel?

There is also the idea that it is colonization because only Palestinians are indigenous to the land, but this idea that there was not also jews living there throughout the centuries are false, and to be fair, the Palestinians who now refer to themselves as Palestinian and as the native inhabitants of Palestine were Syrians, Egyptians, Jordanians, until the fall of the ottoman empire, at which time a movement of indigineity by local identity *began*, but this too only really as a response to the recognition/institution of Israel as a state. 

The final question I have is what do about the entire population of jews in israel who were born in Israel, their parents born in Israel, wh have never lived anywhere else, do not know any other home, do not speak any language but Hebrew? When Israel is 'decolonized' and all the land is given back to the Palestinians and all the Jews go home, where do these people go, what's the idea? Decolonizing Israel is a call for these people to become refugees and it is a call for ethnic cleansing of Israeli Jews.",14/10/23 12:58:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/177ozzb/calling_to_decolonize_israel_makes_no_sense/,148,275,466,Israeli,top,all

s658yw,Yes the UN does discriminate and incite against Israel,"The UN resolutions come up regularly, Israel is a particularly noxious country as evidenced by all the UN resolutions, yadda yadda yadda.  I wanted to point out that Israel faces blatant discrimination. The UN's should be viewed as an enemy of Israel's whose opinion on it should carry no moral weight. If I forget anything please feel free to add to this list in the comments below: 


* **United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)**.  2012-2017 the UNGA passed 150 resolutions condemning countries for actions against a people. 124 of these resolutions, 82.67%,  of all condemnatory resolutions, were against Israel.  In neighboring Syria the Syrian regime killed 500k of its own population the UNGA passed a resolution condemning outside interference or threats to Syrian territorial integrity.  It instructed the world that the Syrian internal political process was the sole legitimate means of ending the Syrian Civil War.  Israel's process conversely was said to demand UN supervision.  It is also worth noting for those who consider Palestine a state there are 0 resolutions against the PA or Hamas ever. 

* **United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)** 2006-2015 UNHRC held 17 emergency sessions, seven of which targeted Israel. Israel is the only country in the world with a permanent item on the UNHRC agenda.  The bias against Israel has been so bad that the USA withdrew its membership, this being a committee that the USA historically had very strong ties to. 

* **UN Peacekeeping Operations** There are 14 peacekeeping operations in the world.  3 target Israel.  United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) sits on Israel's border with Syria.  United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) sits on Israel's border with Lebanon.  United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) prevents the 1947-9 war from restarting supposedly, no I'm not kidding.  UNIFIL has worked with Israel's enemy Hezbollah.  UNTSO has engaged in illegal construction in Jerusalem.

* **United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO)** this is essentially a PA propaganda arm.  UNSCO's position is that Israel bears sole
responsibility for the crises in the West Bank and Gaza. By charter it acts as a spokesman for Palestinian state-building efforts.  It regularly condemns Israeli settlement expansion.  It constructed the  Palestinian Center honoring Palestinian Dalal Mughrabi who died killing 37 civilians in Israel, the only example of a UN paid for center honoring an explicit terrorist.

* **Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA)** Membership is: Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman,
""the State of Palestine”, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, UAE, and Yemen.  You'll notice who isn't listed.  It goes without saying ferocious constant hostility. 


* **Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)** Has authority only in Latin America and the Caribbean, yet regularly attacks Israel.  Israel has no platform in this organization given its geography.  


* **United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)** refuses to encourage trade involving Israel.  Constant blatant hostility on trade issues regarding Gaza in line with Hamas' position.

* **United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)** Has coordinated with Hamas in criminal smuggling operations. Either accidentally or intentionally funded terrorism against Israelis.  

* **United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)** Knowingly willfully and deliberately lied in an official report about the flow of Israeli / Gazan waste water for the purpose of inciting against Israel.

* **United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT)** Has been directly involved in hospitals and schools used by Hamas as weapons depos.  Reports attack Israel rather than admitting this agency is committing war crimes by failing to maintain distinction (i.e. labeling military facilities as civilian).

* **United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)** Pro-Palestinian propaganda.  Palestine traditionally gets 100% of its desired allocation while every other country gets a small percentage.

* **United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women)** Singles out Israel (which is rather well known for excellent sex equality since its founding) for condemnation for gender discrimination.  This is the sole country in the world condemned.  Ignores all human rights and gender inequality perpetrated by Hamas and the PA as a matter of constant practice.  In particular due to their hatred of Israel refuses to address PA laws encouraging rape (if a PA governed woman fails to prove force or deception she is criminally charged with adultery).  Fails to address regular problems of honor killings in PA and Hamas territory.  

* **Commission on the Status of Women (CSW)** Israel is the only country in the world condemned by this group for its treatment of women. 

* **International Labor Organization (ILO)** Condemns Israel annually.  The only country ever to recieve reports about its labor abuses.  North Korea with millions in forced labor or Qatar that essentially has slavery have been members in good standing.

* **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)** This one has had several good quality posts. They are careful not to be explicit but mostly:  denies any ties of Jews to Jerusalem,. denies the Temple Mount, denies Jewish ties to Cave of the Patriarchs. The USA and later Israel has had to quit this organization over its bias.  Their too cute language didn't save them. 

* **World Health Organization (WHO)** Knowingly willfully and deliberately distributes false statements  about the health situation in the West Bank and Gaza for the purpose of incitement against Israel.  That is PA anti-Israeli health propaganda reproduced verbatim.  When false statements are pointed out has refused to retract.

* **World Bank (WB)** Disproportionate focus trying to present the situation in the West Bank as worse than it is.   123 projects (31 active) in the West Bank and Gaza.  63 projects in Myanmar (18 active), 65 in the Republic of Congo (16 active) and 75 in the Central African Republic (15 active).  

* **United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)** Only one report in its history blaming a country for lack of development and that was Israel.

* **United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)** Has claimed that the Israeli occupation reduces clean energy production when the exact opposite is obviously true. Has written reports on Gaza treating Israel as a disaster besetting the area while completely ignoring the role of Hamas.

* **Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS)** UN oversight body that produces reports on UN misconduct.  Israel filed an official complaint against  Rima Khalaf for misconduct.  Complaint ignored violating its charter. 

*  **Department of Political Affairs (DPA)** Has 6 divisions one of which is full time dedicated to serving the Palestinians.  The only group of people in the world with this level of focus from DPA. USA raised this point in an official complaint that say North Korea's nuclear threats or Iran's state sponsorship of terror in almost a dozen countries got almost no focus.  USA complaint ignored.  Division for Palestinian Rights breaks with DPA norms. In all other conflicts DPA covers it has nuance expressing the interests of both sides and seeking reconciliation.  In the case of I/P blames Israel exclusively.  Clear cut counter-race theory that Jews can have no legitimate interests.

* **United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)** Ferocious condemnation of the security barrier when it was being constructed with not a word against the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians which led to it.  Publishes reports on I/P like, ""50 Years of Occupation: detailing the injustices and casualties suffered by Palestinians"". Considers 100% of all Palestinian deaths civilian fatalities (i.e. does not consider Hamas even a guerilla group).  

* **United Nations Department of Public Information (DPI)** Deliberately conflated the Holocaust and the Palestinian Occupation.  Holocaust inversion as a matter of policy.  There are only two standing groups in DPI: decolonization in Africa and the Strategic Communications Division (SCD) which is fully dedicated to Palestine. 

* **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** There have been 27 times in UN history where an advisory ruling was asked for.  In 26 of them terms were established between the two or more parties so all thought the hearing fair.  In the Israeli case, Israel objected, those objections were ignored. The attorneys who argued the case were 5 from Arab countries  and 5 from Muslim non-Arab countries, all hostile to Israel.  0 direct or indirect Israeli representation.  No 3rd party legal representation even as a stand in.  The final ruling calling for the dismantlement of settlements exceeded the UNGA's original referral the first time the ICJ has done such a thing.

* **United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA)** This one has possibly a triple digit number of posts here.  Defines refugees totally contrary to the UNHRC definition (i.e. a unique definition). This definition is designed to expand not contract the number of refugees so as to make the I/P conflict intractable and unsolvable.  Constant recruitment and support for terrorist groups.  Intentional vilification of Jews and Israelis in propaganda directed at children. 

I think this list proves the point.  I want to close to an excellent source on these topics from which I drew this list and has references for more details:   https://en.kohelet.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KPF089_UN_030119_web_R.pdf

193b7vg,(opinion) Hamas Surrendering is Best Thing for Palestinian Cause,"If Hamas surrenders unconditionally, lays down its weapons, turns itself in, shows the IDF where all its weapons and tunnels are, renounce violence it would be the best thing Palestinians could do to become a legitimate movement. 

 Imagine if tomorrow the Palestinians quit their 100 year campaign of violence. This would put Israel completely on the defensive. International and internal pressure on Israeli politicians would force them to negotiate a final settlement. 

If  Hamas throws itself onto the mercy of the Israeli justice system, it would be a demonstration of good will. Israel would likely have to give amnesty to most Hamas members not involved in the October 7th ethnic cleansing attacks. 

 By Hamas doing this, they remove the Boogeyman that Israel uses to justify their military actions. They would cause a immediate ceasefire in Gaza, allowing relief to the Gazan people. The rockets would stop firing on Israeli civilians. Hizbollah would be pressured to stop their hostilities which could calm the Northern borders. Iran would be sidelined somewhat. Judea and Samaria would calm down once the violence committed by Palestinians ceased. The border police could then police the Jewish residents in Judea Samaria, stopping their retaliations. 

 In the absence of violence, Closures and checkpoints could be lifted improving the lives of Arab residents of Judea and Samaria. Israelis could bring their reservists back home from Gaza and families could return to the North.

 Palestinian elections could be held with Hamas dissolved and/or rebranded. The election could put forth the moderate voices of the Palestinians. Israel in the aftermath of October 7th can elect new leaders. 

 Hopefully, this would lead to negotiations and painful compromises from both sides.

 For this to work, extremists on both sides would have to be sidelined. 

The  First step to bring relief to Gaza is for Hamas to surrender. International pressure should be calling for this along with pro Palestinians. That’s the real “ceasefire” they have called for.",10/01/24 15:43:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/193b7vg/opinion_hamas_surrendering_is_best_thing_for/,145,769,323,Israeli,top,all
1adpq0v,The Level of Hatred in Other Subs is Unreal,"I have been watching a lot of Israel/Palestine videos on YouTube lately, periodically, just trying to hear people’s takes. Some are biased, some try not to be. I loved one funny video of this guy running around asking people who they side with, because he didn’t know whether to post if he was for Israel or Palestine, and made a satire of how muddy it has become.

I recently found this sub, and the discussions seem to be at least somewhat civil, with a lot of questions asked, and a slight lean in the base towards Israel. Which seems logical.

Then I wanted to check other subs, specifically ones bout Palestinian culture, just to see what they were all about.

What I found was a hate machine, and not a pretty one.

There was a post, where someone had linked a video. In it, two people are squaring off at a protest, one holding an Israeli flag, the other a Palestinian flag. A white man comes from the side, rips the Israeli flag out of its holders hands, drags it away, bundles it up, and carries it off.

My initial reaction was revulsion. I don’t care who you are, or how you feel, you don’t commit an act of violence and theft on someone like that.

Well, anyone who said anything along the lines of “I agree, but maybe this wasn’t in good taste” was heavily downvoted. The vast majority of people praised this act. Not only was it praised, but there were multiple statements comparing the Israeli flag to the Nazi flag as a justification for why it was okay, and multiple statements of how the flag would make good toilet paper. All of which upvoted, while any calls to reason were downvoted.

My point to this post, I suppose, is how does civility end? How do we return back to it? There are huge factions of people with no interest in discussion (which makes this subreddit great), so how do we talk to them?

Also, I learned a new term today. “Hasbara.” It basically means “explaining” but is used to refer to when Israeli forces/leadership explain why they’ve done something. As a few examples, they refused to give back the Golan Heights because they were used as a mortar position to attack Israel with great terrain advantage, and they closed the border with Gaza because after Hamas took control, it was impossible to maintain security. Well, in that sub, “hasbara” is forbidden and if any is seen they are to be reported immediately.

How do we talk to people who don’t want to hear another side?

I’ve seen a lot of wars in my day, was enlisted during one, but this is new to me. I don’t know how to deal with it. Civil discussion on this topic, on all sides, seems so rare.

How do we find civility again?",29/01/24 07:34:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1adpq0v/the_level_of_hatred_in_other_subs_is_unreal/,150,428,482,Israeli,top,all
17ro8y7,New poll shows Arab Israelis identify 22% more with the State of Israel than before Hamas's massacre on the 7th.,"A [new poll](https://twitter.com/Nadav_Eyal/status/1722694885449335187/photo/1) put out by the [Israel Democracy Institute](https://en.idi.org.il/) shows that Israeli Arabs identify 22% more with the State of Israel than prior to Hamas's massacre on the 7th bringing the total to 70%, a historic milestone. While anti-Zionists will naturally be unable to fathom such a thing being possible, there is plenty of evidence to suggest (at the very least) that there is some level of accuracy to the report.

**Comparison to Operation Guardian of the Walls (May 2021)**

In May of 2021 during rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Arab Israelis began a [large scale riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Israel%E2%80%93Palestine_crisis#Arab_communities_in_Israel) against Jews in mixed cities around Israel. Arab rioters set 10 synagogues and 112 Jewish homes on fire, looted 386 Jewish homes and damaged another 673, and set 849 Jewish cars on fire. There were also 5,018 recorded instances of stone-throwing against Jews. Two Jews were killed during the rioting.

Despite the large scale bombardment of Gaza and the same casus belli used by Hamas to initiate its massacre on the 7th (Jews praying on the Temple Mount) as it did in 2021, there have been (to my knowledge) no instances of Arab Israeli rioting as a result of Israel's response.

**Why wouldn't Israeli Arabs jump in to assist Gaza when Israel's response is far more intense than in 2021 and its troops are divided on multiple fronts?**

In my personal opinion, I think Israeli Arabs realized that Hamas makes no distinction between them and Israeli Jews. When Hamas stormed into Israel and slaughtered civilians they did not care who they murdered. Jews, Palestinians, Bedouins, Druze, foreign workers, tourists, they were all the same to them. Colonizers, traitors, and infidels.

\- In the following footage we see an [Israeli Arab being captured and beaten by Hamas terrorists](https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/comments/17rb69o/arab_israeli_brutally_beaten_and_ultimately/). They force him to lead them to Kibbutz Reim and likely execute him off camera.

\- [Testimony from an Israeli Arab](https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/comments/17l8y4l/israeli_arab_survivor_from_the_7_october_massacre/) whos wife was murdered on the 7th talking about his experience and telling the story of two Arab cab drivers who were shot at point blank by Hamas after identifying themselves as Arab.

\- Additional [testimony from Arab Israelis](https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/comments/17jm3sy/israeli_arab_civilians_witnessed_the_hamas_attack/) after the massacre.

\- [Arab Israelis captured by Hamas](https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/comments/17krrfp/hamas_terrorists_ask_israeli_arabs_at_the_nova/) at Nova Festival. I do not know if they survived.

While I can't speak for Arab Israelis I think what happened on the 7th made it blatantly obvious what the fate of everyone in Israel would be if Hamas succeeded in their goals and put Israel's own actions into a very different light. It has become clear to see that Israel is protecting Jews just as much as it is protecting Arabs from the horror that is Hamas and the prospect of Hamas taking control from River to the Sea is a terrible one that cannot be allowed to pass.

As a result, we have not seen any rioting and have even seen Arab Israelis jump at the opportunity to serve alongside Jews in the IDF or even do [volunteer work](https://twitter.com/danabrahams87/status/1719894980674613507) which I think is a [beautiful sight to behold](https://x.com/mayazi/status/1718175275714851063?s=20).

**Conclusion**

Hamas may have intended for Israel to retaliate against its own Arab citizens but in the end it has only increased our unity and made us stronger as a result. While the world may still be blind to this fact and despite all the progress we have yet to make, it at least appears as though our fellow Arab Israelis recognize we are all equally affected and that it is better that we work together than be forever at odds with one another.",09/11/23 21:59:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17ro8y7/new_poll_shows_arab_israelis_identify_22_more/,150,62,594,Israeli,top,all
n36ldj,About some people’s responses to the Meron Tragedy,"
I’ve been seeing a lot of people say that the 45 people who died in Meron “deserved it because they were settlers and Zionists.” Mainly from Pro-Palestine/Anti-Israel accounts on Twitter and the like.

First of all, chassidim are usually anti-zionist, so the people who died most likely weren’t even Zionist, so that argument goes out the window. These aren’t the same people chanting “kill all the Arabs.” They are a radical group.

Second of all, a lot of the victims weren’t even citizens of Israel, they were either visiting for the event or here for a gap year (who I’m going to the funeral of tonight)

Third of all, some of the victims were CHILDREN! The youngest was 9.

Fourth, and probably most importantly, these people are celebrating the deaths of INNOCENT PEOPLE!

This tragedy has nothing to do with Zionism, and I’m tired of seeing people try and rope Zionism into it by saying the victims were Zionist or Israeli or what have you. These people were just Jews celebrating a holiday. That’s not an excuse to celebrate their deaths. It’s a clear cut example of anti-semitism using anti-zionism as a guise. This is the equivalent of people saying the people who died at the Kaaba disaster of 2015 deserved it because “they’re  Muslims and some Muslims are terrorists so they probably were too so they deserved to die.” 

In closing, please do not relate the deaths of these innocent Jews to Zionism. And don’t use it to celebrate. Let people mourn. Don’t celebrate the deaths of the innocent.


Small update: I was just at the funeral of Donny Morris. So many tears were shed. They live-streamed the funeral as well. Anyone who can still celebrate after something like that are true monsters.",02/05/21 13:39:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/n36ldj/about_some_peoples_responses_to_the_meron_tragedy/,148,98,294,Israeli,top,all
17a1z7m,Palestenian here who's open to discussion with anyone who disagrees with me.,"Hey all, a few things motivated me to try to reach out to others who disagree with me on this conflict.

Namely, I found that quite a few people on my side of the arguement are exposed to so much fake news, which means it's likely I am as well. Moreover, I've been brought up to take it for granted that israel = bad and haven't spent much time questioning it until lately. 

If anyone wants to engage with this and show me how you feel I'd appreciate it, here are some things I believe in that seem to be controversial on this sub:

- The Israeli government is packed with people who have made genocidal statements about Arabs. (I assume these people have popular support since its a democracy) I can give sources if any one actually wishes to challenge this.
- The IDF is currently engaging in collective punishment of the population of Gaza. Displacing 1.1 million civilians under the threat of armed conflict is not humane, especially not in 24 hours. Half of the people killed have been women and children, it does not seem like the attacks are targeted at all. Especially with statements coming out from IDF officials saying that they will pursue 'damage, not accuracy'.
- The idea that Palestenians have repeatedly refused the splitting of land is an absolute lie, and you should be made fun of if you believe it. Palestenians have been negotiating for 1967 border 2 state solution for as long as I remember.
- Gaza is absolutely under occupation, it is surrounded by a wall. Israel controls land, air (airport bombed), and sea (fishermen dead) and have intelligence on most things happening in Gaza. We saw how in one day Israel withheld water, fuel, and electricity. This is unbelievable amount of control to exercise over another population. Denying this because there is no army sitting inside at all times is extremely ignorant.

There are some more I can go into but might explore later depending on how this goes. I concede that most news I'm exposed to is in Arabic, it is generally pro Palestinian, and that I can be misguided by my upbringing and my environment, so all I hope is for civil discussion. Just to be clear I despise Hamas and what happened on October 7th. I hope something good comes out of this. Feel free to challenge me on any one thing you see above.",17/10/23 16:12:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17a1z7m/palestenian_here_whos_open_to_discussion_with/,147,608,409,Israeli,top,all
1akjupc,Why I find it so hard to engage with pro-Palestinians,"Every once in a while I’ll come across someone who leans more pro-Palestine who is sensible and believes Israel still has the right to at the very least exist along with its Jewish citizens. However most people who claim to be anti-Zionist, pro Palestine, or whatever you want to call it I’ve come across don’t even believe Israel has a right to exist and views the country as colonialist outpost of the west that needs to disappear which I have a serious issue with.

So I would say that’s my 1st issue I’m not over here advocating for Palestine to be eradicated yet others I engage with are advocating for Israel’s destruction which I would consider morally wrong. If you consider far right extremists in Israel “bad” why do you think it’s okay to engage in the exact same extremism you claim they do and advocate for their country to disappear apear because of the opinions held by a few? 2 wrongs don’t make a right I thought most of us learned that in elementary school.

My second issue I have is whenever I engage with the group of people who consider themselves anti-Zionists they typically group me in with far right extremists instead of looking at me as an individual and replying to my arguments. I instead am given the least charitable interpretation of where I’m coming from which is a very bad faith way of engaging with people you disagree with. I tend to believe pro-Palestinians as a whole are still good people although I disagree with them and still believe they are at least trying to do the right thing. I don’t think this group views me the same way, instead I am led that they really do think of me as a racist monster who supports genocide against Palestinians. 

My final issue I’ve encountered when engaging with this group is constantly being made out to be a morally inferior human. Constantly being told “you support genocide” “you don’t care about Palestinians” and “you’re an evil person” eventually gets to me. I don’t consider myself a bad person and hope I’m doing the right thing so when I’m told things like this it hurts a little I won’t lie. I’m not over here telling pro Palestinians they support terrorism and would say the minority of people who do that are wrong. I feel like people who lean more pro Israel are much more willing to tell someone considered part of their group when they think something that they are doing is wrong vs when pro Palestinians engage in similar behavior it seems to be encouraged and much more accepted within their group.

These are just my personal experiences and what I’ve dealt with. I understand pro-Israel people also engage in similar behavior but I see it happen much less although that could be my confirmation bias leading me to believe that. When I see this behavior from pro-Israelis I make sure they understand it’s not acceptable so I hope pro-Palestinians will do the same and hold their group accountable rather than excusing it just because they view Israel as the bigger problem.",06/02/24 20:34:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1akjupc/why_i_find_it_so_hard_to_engage_with/,147,624,525,Israeli,top,all
1749zvy,An important message to the world from Israel.,"Hello every one, my name is Daniel.  
  
I am an Israeli jewish living in northern Israel, close to Haifa.  
  
I'm here to write this post today because I want to share the story of what's happening in israel right now, from our own eyes.  
Yes, you might, and maybe reasonabely think that I'm going to be unobjective towards the latest events happened  
because I'm from the ""jewish side"" of the war.  
but let me tell you one thing, I was never one of those who say ""death to the arabs"" or ""all arabs are terrorists"" because they are not  
they are human beings just like us, I never supported or wanted innocent people to be hurt, and even though since I know myself  
we have always been brutally attacked, I never stopped believing that maybe we will be able to live in peace with our enemies, even after all that happened  
between us.  
  
  
In my country, whenever people hear the word ""palestine"" they get mad and angry, most people don't like the idea of palestinians calling themselves  
a ""state that deserves recognition"" because they would like to replace us.  
still, my opinion was always a little different, I always thought to myself that we don't need to shut down the idea of a ""palestinian people""  
because if this is what they believe and want to be, let them be, they deserve to be, they deserve to feel proud and stand for their flag with pride.  
My friends in my life don't really know my opinion, if most of them did, they would probably treat me differently, I don't blame them, both sides  
are just fueling each other with hate, palestinians call death to israel and israel call death to palestine, I don't blame my israeli friends nor the palestinians for  
saying that, this is what they were born to, this is what they know.  
let's make no mistakes, in all of those endless years of war between israel and terrorist organizations, innocent people died on BOTH SIDES, I never denied it, I never will.  
nothing makes me more sad than the sight of innocent people being killed for the sake of war, children, women, people who just want to live  
their lives in peace.  
  
  
The events of the last days may have shuttered the dream of peace between us and palestinians forever, this is sad, but this is the reality.  
I don't know if words can describe or if you guys can even start to comprehend the scale of brutality against humanity that happened in my country in the last days.  
now let me start off with a VERY CLEAR MESSAGE: this post has nothing to do about weather the palestinian resistance to Israel is justified or not and you will  
very soon understand why.  
  
  
let's say that palestinians resistance to our existance and hamas' war is justified, let's even say that they are right and we need to be demolished out of this land.  
This saturday, there was a holiday in Israel, ""sukkot"", on of the holiest and most important days for the jewish people, and yes in those days as on many holidays  
there were alot of celebrations and parties in Israel.  
one of those celebrations was a big psytrance festival called ""universo parelello Israel"" attended by 3500 young people that just wanted  
to listen to music, enjoy life and spread love, innocent people, unarmed, women, children.  
the party took place in an area about 10 - 15 minutes drive from gaza.  
at about 6 in the morning hamas started launching hundreds of rockets towards Israel, the party was of course stopped, dissapointed people who just wanted  
to celebrate were asked to live and run for their lives, police authority told them to escape and go back home.  
it took them alot of time to digest what is going on, so people started slowly leaving the area, now it doesnt take 5 minutes to leave a party like that.  
you need to rest a little, understand what is going on, pack all of your stuff, walk to the car, put everything inside and then slowly drive out with everybody.  
about 10 - 20 minutes after the party was closed and people were about to live, the area was still full of people, thousand of people, not knowing the hell  
that they are soon about to face.  
  
  
it was at that time that hamas monsters, inhuman pieces of garbange landed in that area and more areas in the country, they broke into the Israeli border  
through the land and through the air.  
they landed in the area of that party after probably seeing all thousand of people from the air and planning the attack on them.  
since they landed, the attack started, dosens of terrorists just started massacaring those thousand of young kids in the area, shooting EVERYONE with  
automatic kalachnikov's, EVERYONE.  
  
  
you can just imagine the panic and hell those guys felt, being shot from absolutely everywhere with automatic weapons, being slaughtered alive,  
people just tried to run for their lives, hiding everywhere possible, in every disgusting place you can imagine.  
all of that while stepping on bodies of other people, watching their friends brutally killed in front of their eyes, being shot again and again just to make sure  
they are dead, cars crashed, rolled over, people shot in their cars trying to escape, they burned cars with people inside them, people who managed  
to somehow escape this hell and hide somewhere had to stay on the ground barely breathing, for long HOURS, hearing their friends screaming in horror  
while shot brutally from every single place, people got kidnapped, they shot their legs so they won't be able to try and escape, they kidnapped  
young women and men, they shot innocent unarmed young men and women not only with AKs, but with RPGs, hand grenades, they slaughtered  
them with knives and cold blood weapons.  
  
  
There are unimaginable recorded calls of parents on the phone with their young children, trying to understand what the hell is going on  
with their kids, hearing everything going on LIVE on the phone call, people needed to listen to their dears trying to escape hell, while some of them  
heard their children dying in screams on the phone calls, yes, on the phone calls, I heard a recorded call of a girl screaming in the phone with her  
family hearing everything as she is begging for her life screaming ""NO PLEASE NO NO"", you hear gunshots and she is just getting calm realizing she got shot, that  
she is about to die, saying good bye to her lovers and hanging the phone.  
same horrifying stuff as 9/11 when people called their lovers to say good bye, but even more brutal.  
this is just ONE of thousands of stories like that.  
in that area alone, those pieces of garbage slaughtered 250 young people, and brutally injured THOUSANDS of innocent unarmed men and women.  
  
  
if you think it ends here, it didn't, it was just the beginning of the plan of one of the biggest massacres the world has even known.  
They broke into settlements and communities with all of their military equipment, and started running from house to house to house, slaughtering kids, women, disabled  
people, elders, everyone, just everyone.  
they shot young girls to death in front of their parents, leaving familys to suffer watching their dears dying in front of their eyes, recording  
filming, joking, laughing at them at their lowest point of their life while making live streams from the familys' stolen phones.  
they recorded all of that LIVE on those familys facebook and instagram accounts so everyone could see the horrors they are going through.  
they broke into secure spaces where people tried to desperately hide for their lives and just shot everyone brutally with automatic weapons, again, recording  
everything, how they shoot children and women to death with no honor or mercy.  
not only on houses and neighbourhoods, but also in the streets, they went out, running everywhere, killing EVERYONE, they massacred HUNDREDS  
of people in the streets, destroying entire familys in seconds everywhere.  
children 5 and 10 and 15 years old had to watch their parents shot to death in front of their eyes in their cars just driving to travel outside in this holiday, screaming  
for their lives in horror, until brave police officers risked their lives to rescue them out of the car, they have been there for long minutes screaming  
and begging for help and everything while their parents blood is spread all over them.  
all of those horrors are not even the tip of the iceberg.  
  
  
they slaughtered 1000 people, 1000 people, those 1000 people contain children, women, disabled people, elders and babys.  
Don't forget that all of this hell is happening while they keep shooting rockets at civilians EVERY SINGLE MINUTE.  
And the hostages, those garbages kidnapped women and BABYS, BABYS, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KIDNAP A BABY FOR?  
WHY THE HELL DO YOU KIDNAP KIDS, WHY DO YOU KIDNAP ELDERS, WHAT TACTICAL ADVANTAGE DOES IT GIVE YOU, THIS IS DONE  
IN THE NAME OF SATANIC CRUELTY, AND THEY UPLOAD VIDEOS RECORDING THOSE KIDS, THOSE BABYS, LAUGHING AND IRRITATING THEM.  
HOW CRUEL CAN YOU BE?  
I wish that the faces of those miserable mothers that you broke their hearts to pieces will haunt you down to hell.  
  
  
You know, if those terrorists would come here with a target to occupy our country and defeat us, I wouldn't even write this post.  
One can understand and theoretically it is justified in a state of war to fight soldiers, fight police officers, conquer areas, kill armed men that  
can risk you in some way, if all they did was focusing on military and tactical targets, I wouldn't even condemn them as an enemy, because that is what you do  
in war, you kill the enemy soldiers, you kill armed men, those are the unwritten rules of war, and war is ugly.  
what happened here this saturday is FAR FAR FAR beyond ugly, FAR beyond war, FAR beyond cruel, what happened this saturday is SATANIC, listen to my words.  
listen to my words when I tell you we are dealing with not less then satanic monsters, and those satanic monsters are just a few kilometers away from us.  
and let me tell you, those monsters successfuly made our lives miserable every day and day since we exist, but I have NEVER, EVER imagined I will witness  
such things going on in my life, in my country, I never thought I would witness the massacre of 1000 innocent people in such a brutal way.  
those are by far the darkest days of my life, of our life here in israel, my people and country is gonna be left traumatic and scarred FOR EVER.  
  
  
I have absolutely no clue how those kids and children are going to live with the horrors they have witnessed and seen, no idea.  
If this is not the ULTIMATE PROOF for everyone in this world that those are satanic monsters, you are just closing your eyes.  
Those monsters targets are not tactical or political or what ever, those monsters did all of this FOR FUN.  
and let me tell you one more thing about them.  
If those idiots would really use the once in a lifetime chance they were somehow given to conquer Israel, and put all of their energy in tactical and military  
targets, who knows how much they could get closer to actual conquer.  
  
  
Don't lie to yourselves and tell yourselves heroic stories about how those monsters fought bravely for conquering the Israeli enemy.  
Those coward chickens, their last target was to conquer, last in the list of barbarically slaughtering and destroying and massacring kids and women.  
I honestly wanna thank Hamas deeply from my heart for one thing, we should thank them so much for doing all of the hard work for us by just stupidly documenting and recording everything  
uploading every single piece of evidence to the internet, showing all of the world how satanic and brutal they are, and what  
are their REAL targets, just look how stupid and idiotic they are, and they think people would actually believe their edited videos with cinematic music ""fighting"" soldiers.  
If someone ever could think to himself that we need to make peace with those monsters or live with them after those events, just watch those movies if your soul is brave enough  
and then come back here and say it, I DARE YOU.  
  
  
How can anyone support them? I honestly don't understand, if you support those monsters you are either STUPID or just EVIL.  
if you dont support those monsters I honestly don't care if you are against israel, if you think we have no rights to live here, anything, I would respect you.  
Yes, I say it LOUD AND CLEAR, I Respect our enemies, I respect those who want to conquer us, I respect those who want us out of the way  
but not like that, not what those monsters are doing, ""Enemies"" is a too honorable title for those monsters, those monsters are the face of evil  
those monsters are the lowest disgrace this planet has even known.  
  
  
And I tell you one more thing, to everyone in this world, listen to my message, you will sooner or later understand what you are dealing with.  
just imagine what would happen if those monsters would grow bigger.  
Israel is the shield of the middle east, Israel is the best country for muslims to live in, ask every muslim in this country  
if he would rather live here, work, study, grow, and be part of a normal society or live in Iran or Syria under demonic dictatorship.  
  
  
Hamas made the biggest mistake of their lives, the sealed their destiny, listen to my words, they would wish the never did it.  
I am so sorry that so many innocent people on both sides will suffer from this war, but next time you are coming here to blame us for it  
just remember that story and who lead their people into this, after years of making our lives miserable, we still tried everything to stay restrained.  
This time they have crossed the line by MILES.  
  
  
Our leadership is FURIOUS, our people are furious, and now those monsters will wish they would never been born.  
now that we have control over the situation inside Israel and we are out of the shock, we will haunt down every single member of  
that satanic group, and I promise you, I promise in the name of justice they will pay for their actions.

The Arab World for Research and Development is a polling institute out of Birzeit University, a Palestinian university located in the West Bank. This poll was conducted by Palestinians, and [here's what it found.](https://www.awrad.org/files/server/polls/polls2023/Public%20Opinion%20Poll%20-%20Gaza%20War%202023%20-%20Tables%20of%20Results.pdf)

  How much do you support the military operation carried out by the Palestinian resistance led by Hamas on October 7th? 

- Extremely support:  68.3% in the West Bank,  46.6% in Gaza
- Somewhat support:  14.8% in the West Bank,  17.0% in Gaza

 So in total, 59.3% of Palestinians ""extremely support"" the 10/7 ""military operation"" and 15.7% ""somewhat support"" it. 

It's time to end the narrative that Hamas are the violent extremists who don't represent anyone but themselves and the Palestinian people are anti-war, peaceful, and don't agree with Hamas. This reality must be recognized in order to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the current war. 

Oh, and let's do one more for good measure

17sv0ye,"An Israeli combat medic vatern, want to share my story and my toughts","Hi All,  
I'm an Israeli IDF vatern, and I want to share my story with you, the idea of sharing my story is to create conversation with people to make the conflict more clear and maybe we can start creating a solution by talking and not by fighting.  
  
When me and my friend were 17, each one of us had to decide what we'll do in the IDF, some of my friends went to the cyber units, some went to be combatants in different units in the IDF, and I was clueless, as a liberal, I didnt want to go to the army and kill people, neither Palestinians in Gaza or the West Bank, I also didnt believe in wars whatsoever so after a lot of toughts and hard decesions, I decided to go and become a combat medic, the idea was that Medics are more about saving lifes then taking them, and if I will get into a gun fight, there will always be other soldiers that will probably be able to handle the situation, worst case scenario, I will just kill myself and won't be an hostage.  
I always refused to kill anyone, I dont have it in me, I personally cant imagine taking the life of another human being, that was just sickening to think about, and I couldn't bare the consequences of doing so.  
  
So I started my journey in August 2014 in the Israeli army, got through tough times and finished the combat medic training with honors, a certain IDF commander came to me and said that due to my great skills I should become a commander that will train other combat medics in the future, I agreed, ofcourse, as I didnt want to kill no one, training the next generations of combat medics sounded like a great deal for me, I got tested, finished that test succesfully, but then, I had to go to go through the practical learning stage, I had to go and be a medic before I can actually teach it.  
  
December 2014, I was assigned to a special unit in the north, next to the Syrian border, quite close to Hezbollah militants, and what I learned about the IDF was quite shocking, I learned that in the Syrian border, Israeli troops goes every night to the Syrian borders and treat injured civilians and rebels against the Assad regime, as I was part of the unit that takes those wounded people to the Israeli hospitals in the north, I knew my future as a combat medic will not be trauma-free.  
  
The first one was a 5 years old kid, came with his mother (we wouldnt allow kids to come alone obviously), who had brain injury so severe, he died in our Ambulance on the way to the hospital, I want you to Imagine for a second, whats it like to be a fresh combat medic and having a 5 years old Syrian kid die in front of your eyes, his mother's reaction was so horrible I still have nightmares with her tearing eyes to this day, her 5 years old kid has died due to Assad's army bombing civilians and kids.  
  
I dont want to make it too long as its already a long post, but I treated over 200 wounded Syrians during my 6 mothes period in the border, one my team member got shot in the Syrian border after Assad's army ambushed us when trying to take wounded rebels to the hospitals.  
  
I've grown since then, got married and have a doughter that I love from the depth of my heart,  
I have three reason I'm writing this story down:  
1. To show you that the IDF are not monsters who seek to harm everyone  
2. To get to know more Palestinians who just want to talk and create a better future together.  
3. To show how the world is hypocrite by boycotting Israel's right to defend itself, while assad and Hezbollah kills civilians and childrens all the time.  
I feel sorry for palestinian people today, they are contolled by their own Assad = Hamas,  
Which makes them more misrable and creates a bad future for all of us.  
  
I really wish you all the best and thank you for reading this short story of my experience.  
  
IF YOU WANT TO TALK WITH ME PRIVATLY, I WILL GLADLY GIVE MY LIFE FOR A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL OF US.    ",11/11/23 14:03:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17sv0ye/an_israeli_combat_medic_vatern_want_to_share_my/,142,232,740,Israeli,top,all
1bb5vuz,Gaza Health Ministry refuses to state how many deaths are combatant deaths. Why?," The Gaza Health Ministry reported approximately 31,000 deaths by the end of last week, asserting that the majority were women and children. However, they have not disclosed how many of these deaths were combatants. Israel estimates that nearly half of the deaths in Gaza were combatants. On February 19, the IDF announced that it had eliminated over 12,000 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters.  
Meanwhile Biden repeats criticism of Netanyahu, says he is ‘hurting Israel more than helping’. Biden was asked if he had a “red line with Netanyahu,” and specifically whether the Israeli Defense Force ground operation in Rafah constituted a red line.  
“It is a red line, but I’m never going to leave Israel,” Biden responded. “The defense of Israel is still critical, so there’s no red line \[where\] I’m going to cut off all weapons so they don’t have the Iron Dome to protect them.”   
Biden identified Palestinian deaths as a red line for his administration.   
“You cannot have another 30,000 Palestinians dead as a consequence of going after them \[Hamas\],” the president stated.   
In recent days, Biden has several times quoted the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry’s death figures without distinguishing between civilian and combatant deaths. The Gaza Health Ministry also refuses to state how many deaths are combatant deaths. Its figures have not been independently verified and appear to contradict information provided by the Israeli government.

1766ke5,"Debunking the trope ""Israel created Hamas""","I've seen this breathtaking claim being made all across Reddit over the last few days, so I did a little research. The biggest source I found that makes this claim is [a video and article from The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/), a media outlet that has a left wing bias. If you watch the video and listen to the tone of the presenter, you can tell that he is almost gleeful in trying to make the point that anything that Hamas perpetrates against Israel is Israel's own doing.

But let's just follow the evidence they present, and see if it adds up to the claim they are making:

1) A quote from Yitzhak Segev, a former Israeli military governor in Gaza in the early 1980s, taken from a book called ""Arab and Jew: Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land"". In there (taken from Google Books search), I find this quote: ""...Segev once told me how he financed the Islamic movement as a counterweight to the PLO and the Communists. ""The Israeli government gave me a budget, and the military budget gives to the mosques"", he said. (That early funding helped nourish the seeds of Hamas and other Muslim movements that used terrorism to undermine the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.)""

2) A quote from Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for more than two decades, in an article from 2009 in the Wall Street Journal. The quote is as follows: ""“Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel’s creation.""

Both those points seem pretty damning at first, but if you actually [read the WSJ article from 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20090926212507/http:/online.wsj.com/article/SB123275572295011847.html), you get a much deeper analysis of what happened, an analysis which does not support the conclusion being drawn by The Intercept.

I recommend reading the full article from WSJ, as it is very comprehensive and interesting. But I am going to quote some of the most relevant parts and highlight some relevant points:

> * The Palestinian cause was for decades l**ed
by the PLO**, which Israel regarded as a
**terrorist outfit** and sought to crush until the
1990s, when the PLO dropped its vow to
destroy the Jewish state.
* When Israel first encountered Islamists in Gaza in the 1970s and '80s, they seemed focused on
studying the Quran, **not on confrontation with Israel**. The Israeli government officially recognized
a precursor to Hamas called Mujama Al-Islamiya, registering the group as a charity. It allowed
Mujama members to set up an Islamic university and build mosques, clubs and schools.
Crucially, Israel often stood aside when the Islamists and their secular left-wing Palestinian rivals
battled, sometimes violently, for influence in both Gaza and the West Bank.
* When it became clear in the early 1990s that Gaza's Islamists had mutated from a religious
group into a fighting force aimed at Israel -- particularly after they turned to suicide bombings in
1994 -- **Israel cracked down** with ferocious force
* Mr. Segev says he had regular contact with Sheikh Yassin, in part to **keep an eye on him**. He
visited his mosque and met the cleric around a dozen times. It was illegal at the time for Israelis
to meet anyone from the PLO. Mr. Segev later arranged for the cleric to be taken to Israel for
hospital treatment. ""We had no problems with him,"" he says.
In fact, the cleric and Israel had a shared enemy: secular Palestinian activists. After a failed
attempt in Gaza to oust secularists from leadership of the Palestinian Red Crescent, the Muslim
version of the Red Cross, Mujama staged a violent demonstration, storming the Red Crescent
building. Islamists also attacked shops selling liquor and cinemas. The **Israeli military mostly
stood on the sidelines**.
Mr. Segev says the army didn't want to get involved in Palestinian quarrels but **did send soldiers**
to prevent Islamists from burning down the house of the Red Crescent's secular chief, a socialist
who supported the PLO
* Brig. Gen. Shalom
Harari, then a military intelligence officer in Gaza, says he received a call from Israeli soldiers
manning a checkpoint on the road out of Gaza. They had stopped a bus carrying Islamic
activists who wanted to join the battle against Fatah at Birzeit. ""I said: '**If they want to burn each
other let them go**,'"" recalls Mr. Harari.
A leader of Birzeit's Islamist faction at the time was Mahmoud Musleh, now a pro-Hamas
member of a Palestinian legislature elected in 2006. He recalls how usually aggressive Israeli
security forces **stood back and let conflagration develop**. He **denies any collusion** between his
own camp and the Israelis, but says ""they hoped we would become an alternative to the PLO.""
A year later, in 1984, the Israeli military received a tip-off from Fatah supporters that Sheikh
Yassin's Gaza Islamists were collecting arms, according to Israeli officials in Gaza at the time.
**Israeli troops raided a mosque and found a cache of weapons. Sheikh Yassin was jailed**. He told
Israeli interrogators the weapons were for use against rival Palestinians, not Israel, according to
Mr. Hacham, the military affairs expert who says he spoke frequently with jailed Islamists. **The
cleric was released after a year** and continued to expand Mujama's reach across Gaza.
* Mr. Harari, the military intelligence officer, says this and other warnings were ignored. But, he
says, t**he reason for this was neglect, not a desire to fortify the Islamists: ""Israel never financed
Hamas. Israel never armed Hamas**.""
Roni Shaked, a former officer of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, and author of a book
on Hamas, says Sheikh Yassin and his followers had a long-term perspective whose dangers
were not understood at the time. ""They worked slowly, slowly, step by step according to the
Muslim Brotherhood plan.""
* In 1987, several Palestinians were killed in a traffic accident involving an Israeli driver, triggering
a wave of protests that became known as the first Intifada, Mr. Yassin and six other Mujama
Islamists launched Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement. Hamas's charter, released a
year later, is studded with anti-Semitism and declares ""jihad its path and death for the cause of
Allah its most sublime belief.""
Israeli officials, **still focused on Fatah and initially unaware of the Hamas charter, continued to
maintain contacts with the Gaza Islamists**. Mr. Hacham, the military Arab affairs expert,
remembers taking one of Hamas's founders, Mahmoud Zahar, **to meet** Israel's then defense
minister, **Yitzhak Rabin**, as part of regular consultations between Israeli officials and Palestinians
not linked to the PLO. Mr. Zahar, the only Hamas founder known to be alive today, is now the
group's senior political leader in Gaza.
In 1989, Hamas carried out its first attack on Israel, abducting and killing two soldiers. Israel
**arrested Sheikh Yassin and sentenced him to life. It later rounded up more than 400 suspected
Hamas activists,** including Mr. Zahar, and deported them to southern Lebanon. There, they
hooked up with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed A-Team of anti-Israeli militancy.

I don't know how anyone can read this article and come to the conclusion ""Israel created Hamas"". It clearly lays out the Hamas was founded by Islamists who, **before creating Hamas**, were political rivals of the PLO, a terrorist group famous for high profile attacks such as Entebbe, Munich and Black September. The Islamists were at first a charitable and educational outfit (and Israel may have contributed some money to the mosques to facilitate aid and education in Gaza), and when they became militant they were fighting against the PLO, and not Israel. Israel kept an eye on the group fighting against their enemy, the PLO, and tolerated their existence, i.e. they did not interfere when they battled the PLO, but on occasion did in fact intervene when they went to far, and in fact jailed the leader Sheikh Yassin when he started to hoard weapons. A few years later Hamas was actually founded, and when they attacked Israel they immediately cracked down on them by arresting their leader, sentencing him to life, and deporting hundreds of their members to Lebanon. Both Israel and Hamas deny any collusion between the two.

There is no proof Israel ever armed Hamas, there is no proof Israel ever financed Hamas. There is evidence Israel tolerated the precursor group to Hamas, a group that had never attacked Israel, by standing aside and observing them, and intervening only occasionally. 

This claim has been twisted by people who want to show that anything that Hamas does to Israel is Israel simply reaping what they have sown. The truth is, Israel never gave any material support to Hamas. Hamas has been built up into what they are today by direct funding and supplies from the regime in Iran.",12/10/23 13:07:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1766ke5/debunking_the_trope_israel_created_hamas/,145,345,1445,Israeli,top,all
v2i34h,The intolerance in r/palestine compared to r/israel is representative of the dynamic of the conflict,"The intolerance of dissent and the level of bigotry in r/palestine compared with the relative tolerance for dissent, the attempts at dialogue and at understanding the other side in r/israel is a very good representation of the dynamic of the conflict.

Ironically, the will for openness and acceptance of dissent is often interpreted as a sign that Israel's position is weak rather than the opposite.

Criticism or dissent and even a mere sympathetic comment to Israel in r/palestine will often result in a permanent ban without previous warning or attempts at dialogue. There is no attempt to understand or god forbid sympathize with the other side. Anything that does not follow a virulent anti-israel line is dismissed as 'zionist propaganda' and, you guessed it, banned. Antisemitism is often celebrated.

By comparing what goes on in r/israel and r/palestine it is easy to understand the frustration of Israelis and their sense that there is no one to talk to on the other side.

Until those who tolerate disagreement and are willing to try to understand the other side become more dominant in the Palestinian side it will be difficult to find a solution to the conflict that does not imply complete capitulation of one side.",01/06/22 14:19:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/v2i34h/the_intolerance_in_rpalestine_compared_to_risrael/,145,302,204,Israeli,top,all
157grjy,My experiences seem to be a huge inconvenience to the anti-Israeli movement,"A lot of you know me here and in other Israel/Palestine subs by now.

I'm not Jewish, Muslim, Arab, Palestinian or Israeli. I consider myself left-leaning, and I'm not religious in the slightest.

I'm British, but I've lived in a few places here and there. I served in the British Army and deployed on two operations, while sending soldiers on operations practically everywhere, including Afghanistan and Iraq.

Before my military service I traveled to Israel with an ex girlfriend, who's Israeli. I absolutely loved the place. The next time I returned I'd signed up to a ""Teach English in Palestine"" program, and lived with a Palestinian family in Hebron for a few months.

After my military service, I moved to Israel with a different ex-girlfriend, who I was engaged to (until recently). Now I'm in Tel Aviv on a work visa, deciding what to do next.

My experiences seeing Israel and living here during some of the recent spikes of rockets, attacks, and operations, and also living with a Palestinian family for several months in what is considered one of the hardest-hit cities in the West Bank, made me look at the conflict in a whole different light. My time in the British Army helps too... I know what's ""normal"" in a conflict, and what shouldn't happen.

I consider myself neutral in the conflict... I support a two state solution. There are hateful narratives about both countries, primarily that Israelis are racist and that Palestinians are terrorists. I stand up against both of these notions because they're simply not true.

Yet I see that the side my experiences seem to anger the most is the anti-Israeli side. When I explain that Israel is not a particularly racist country, I find people either claim I have only experienced a bubble of Israel, or some on Reddit claim they don't believe I had these experiences, as if I'm some kind of Israeli government agent planted to spread lies. The anti-Israel side can seriously push people away if they don't subscribe to their very specific, very curated, and sometimes fabricated narrative of events. I think this is demonstrated in the r/Israel and r/Palestine subs, where the former seems to be full of normal conversation, and the latter seems to be only about attacking Israel and nothing else. This is an enormous shame, because Palestine has a rich culture, a fascinating history, and some amazing people... most of whom are just getting on with their lives and don't care about politics.

This situation makes me pessimistic about the conflict.

od4ugp,How did Zionism become A second word for Evil ?,"The original meaning of Zionism was to support the creation of a territory in the region of Zion in which Jews have the ability to safeguard the protection and safety of other Jews. Which is a pretty rational thinking considering anti-Semitism was high all throughout history, especially if you know the reason for the Zionist congress by hertzel was the dreyfus affair, which had pretty obvious signs of extreme anti-Semitism.
And anti-Zionism **IS** anti-Semitism since these people basically support a violent diaspora of Jews to a STILL very hostile world

its really dangerous that people around the world cant understand the definition of Zionism since this conflict is very grey and both sides have innocence and blame.

Besides Hamas already breaking the agreement by refusing to allow medical teams to inspect the hostages, separating family members, attacking Israeli troops in Gaza with gunfire/explosives, and killing three Israelis in a shooting attack in Jerusalem, Hamas has just violated the agreement yet again by not providing a list of hostages to be released by 7am and firing rockets at southern Israel.

After all these violations Israel has finally decided to respond and has resumed its bombardment of Gaza.

17hagj8,I haven’t Forgotten About Shani Louk,"I’m a Palestinian American that condemns Hamas’s existence and their actions. Hamas supporters & sympathizers alike used the Hamas propaganda video of them freeing the two old lady hostages to deny that Hamas brutally murdered families in their own homes and brutally murdered the young people in the festival. They also completely removed the parts of Yocheved Lifshitz’s interview afterwards in which she talked about witnessing atrocities of Hamas in her neighborhood when they destroyed homes and killed people. They also ignored that their husbands are still captive. All to try and paint Hamas in a good light. But the Shani Louk incident was very high profile and it happened early on. It was something even the most delusional Hamas supporters couldn’t deny occurred. Yet that’s now completely forgotten about and because Hamas were on camera handing sweets to the old ladies now suddenly “the media is lying about Hamas’s atrocities”. Parading Shani Louk’s body for the world and her family to see should have been MORE than enough to turn any human being with the most basic moral standards against Hamas. But no the delusion continues. As of today her mother is still not sure about her whereabouts and I can only assume she’s passed. If she has then may she rest peace. She did not deserve her fate. Rest in peace to the rest of the innocent Israeli civilians that were brutally tortured and killed. And rest in peace to the innocent Gazan civilians going through hell because Hamas decided using money & resources to attack Israel was more important than taking care of their own people. I wish God existed because we need him more than ever. I want God to free the hostages and for each and every single Hamas member and especially the leaders to suffer the most brutal fates imaginable. I want God to help rebuild Gaza to be a peaceful place in which most can live peaceful fulfilling lives without hate in anybody’s hearts. And if the family of Shani Louk ever see this post my heart goes out to you and i’m sending you all my love and prayers. I’m sorry you had to experience the brutality of the world in such a manner.

ix2o3x,Zionism and Palestinian Freedom Aren’t Opposed,"I am an American who is very engaged in politics, and I am generally in the leftist camp on socioeconomic issues, as I identify as an Democratic Socialist.

I’m also an American who began seriously considering converting to Judaism in the last year and a half, and I must say that my perspective on the I/P Conflict has shifted dramatically over that time.

In my studies and explorations in this period, I’ve come across some very troubling trends in the discussion of Zionism and its relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially in leftist communities.

Palestinians and their cause have been championed by the Western Left since at least 1967, and I completely understand why. As the alliance between Israel and the American government grew, Israel became increasingly associated with Western Imperialism and right-wing politics. 

Meanwhile the Palestinians (who largely replaced the rest of the Levantine Arabs as the primary adversary of Israel after 1967) became increasingly associated with leftist goals of national liberation, especially considering the PLO and PFLP’s alliance and solidarity with other leftist national liberation struggles in Northern Ireland, Vietnam, Latin America, Africa etc.

As a result, a substantial number of people today are hung up on this idea that the mere existence of the State of Israel is an inherent negation of the right of Palestinians to live in peace and freedom in the land.

I am sick and tired of this dishonesty from people who should know better.

Zionism is the belief that Jews have a right to freedom, defense, and self-determination in Palestine/Eretz Israel, their historic homeland.

It is not the belief that Jews should have the sole right to control all territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. 

It is not the belief that Jews should maintain an ethnic majority in the land. 

It is not the belief that Palestinians should be subjugated or cordoned off into Apartheid-style Bantustans.

The goal of Zionism is to have a land and a place of refuge for Jews where they are not strangers. It is to have a national home where they are not at the mercy of the whims of a non-Jewish majority. 

After 2000 years of wandering and persecution which culminated in the worst targeted mass murder in modern history, Zionists want to end this cycle once and for all by returning to their national home.

Palestinian Nationalism is predicated on the belief that Palestinian Arabs should also have the right to freedom, defense, and self-determination in their historic homeland of the Levant, which includes Palestine.

These goals can be accomplished without negating either positions.

I want leftists and western pro-Palestinian activists to stop equating Zionism with the post-1967 status quo. I want them to stop equating Zionism with Netanyahu, the Likud, and Yamina. I want them to stop treating all Israelis as though they support the occupation. I want them to stop enabling and making excuses for terrorism and extremist violence. I want them to push a vision of peace that acknowledges the rights of both groups of human beings living in the former British Mandate.

I want Israeli right-wingers to engage with Palestinians in good faith and acknowledge their human rights. I want them to acknowledge Palestinian self-determination. I want them to accept the idea that safety is not an excuse for oppression and injustice. I want them to acknowledge that both Jews and Palestinians have a right to live in the land.

The one I've out forward in the headline obviously bolsters the Israeli/Jewish side because it shows how open they are yet closed the Arabs/Muslims are to Jews. 

Another example would be the death toll. This is clearly in Hamas/Palestine's favour because do I need to explain.. Yes I still put all those deaths on Hamas for using human shields but that would be subjective of me, you see?

You could also take the number of times a ceasefire was called for and who agreed how many times and who disagreed how many times in order to highlight the propensity for violence. There may also be different types of ceasefires and different lengths that might be measurable. 

We could look at polls: both sides appear to want the conflict to continue. I am unsure of exact recent numbers but I am fairly confident in bringing up the stat that 80% of Palestinians endorse the activities of Oct 7th and on the flip side most Israelis appear to be okay with the IDF continuing in their goal of eliminating Hamas despite the civilian casualties.

o2xjla,Treatment of Israeli Arabs before 1966,"The [Akevot institute](https://www.akevot.org.il/en/military-rule/#section/1) has spent a lot of time deciphering and digitizing documents from Israel's military rule of its Arab citizens until 1966 - and it is a treasure trove of information.

A common misconception is that Israel granted equal rights and citizenship to the Palestinians that remained within its borders. This is often overshadowed by the recent conflict - but I thought a post clarifying some points about the life of Arab Israelis in the early state, and how it reverberates for Israeli Arabs today.

Here's a few examples of what they faced:

* They were given limited political rights - often forced to vote for '[satellite lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_satellite_lists)' if they were able to vote at all. Arab parties were stopped from being formed
* 40-60% of the properties owned by Palestinians with Israeli citizenship were confiscated through designating them as '[present absentees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_absentee)', often despite having returned to their homes. [Iqrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqrit) is one of the most famous examples - and a grave injustice. This is also why the recent Sheikh Jarrah issues come off as so hypocritical - Jewish Israelis can reclaim property, but Israeli Arabs can't.
* They often faced violence, curfews, and other discrimination - a great [article here](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT.MAGAZINE-how-israel-tormented-arabs-in-its-first-decades-and-tried-to-cover-it-up-1.9433728), drawing on Akevot's research. Curfew for 18 years, they needed permits to move or travel inside Israel,
* Discrimination remained for a long time - as outlined by the [Or Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Or_Commission) in 2000, following the police using live fire against Israeli Arab rioters
* 

Jewish Israelis may not think much or remember this - but for Israeli Arabs this discrimination is very much present in their memory and conceptualization of Israel. The Israeli government made it very clear from the start that they *were not equal citizens* \- no matter what the basic laws say.

From the recent [Haaretz article:](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT.MAGAZINE-how-israel-tormented-arabs-in-its-first-decades-and-tried-to-cover-it-up-1.9433728)

>Although this part of the past has largely been repressed among most of Israel’s Jewish population, it constitutes an integral part of the identity and collective memory of the country’s Arab citizens.

The article goes into great detail and is worth a read, no matter your perspective on the conflict.

All in all, one thing this means is that there's actually only a few months during 1966 and 1967 that Israel *didn't* rule people with limited political rights.

This is how the death of 17 year old Amjad al-Fayyed is shown to the world: A cold blooded execution by Israeli occupiers, with the sole intention of performing ""ethnic cleansing"" in Palestine. Is it though?

gnle2w,Can we stop blaming Israel for kids Hamas kills?,"Original title was ""Can we please stop blaming Israel for the dead children that Hamas puts in the line of fire?"", but theres a 50 character limit so i had to butcher it a little...

&#x200B;

Its very disturbing to me that when you talk to a lot of the anti zionist crowd about the conflict they keep talking about children killed. Yes a ridiculous number of children are killed in this conflict, yet israel goes to equally ridiculous lengths to minimize civilian casualties. The problem is hamas is doing everything they can to maximize these casualties (especially children), all to pit people against israel. By blaming israel for the actions of hamas you are essentially letting them get away with it.

&#x200B;

It is a fact, firstly, that hamas launches mortars from palestinian civilian areas at israeli civilian areas. Israels (and any governments) first responsibility is to keep its citizens SAFE. So they respond with a surgical strike. Hamas bug out and ensure there are civilians left to die. Theres even evidence of them setting up explosives around the area that will be triggered by israels surgical strike. Making a far bigger explosion and hurting far more people than the IDF couldve possibly known.

&#x200B;

Secondly their insistence of using human shields (and yes, ive seen the videos on youtube of IDF soldiers supposedly doing the same thing, bringing a translator with you or detaining somebody in a car is NOT a human shield)

&#x200B;

And probably most disturbing of all is the brainwashing these kids receive at school and at home. All you need do is search youtube for ""palestinian childrens shows"", which IMHO is the most fucked up shit ive ever seen. Youve got little 6 year old girls talking about how much they hate jews and how they want nothing more than to be martyred. They are literally raising kids to believe the greatest thing they can accomplish in life, the most noble thing they can do, is to die whilst killing jews.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry but HOW THE FUCK is israel (OR ANYONE) meant to prevent children dying in that situation? It's damn near impossible.

Yes sure theres innocent bystanders accidentally shot, happens in any armed conflict, however the fact that theres so goddamn many can be attributed directly to the actions of hamas (and i havent even talked about their penchant for storing explosives in UN run schools or firing mortars from hospitals, im only covering the bare basics here)

&#x200B;

The IDF (an army made up mostly of conscripted teenagers) doesnt wanna kill children, its not something they set out to do (and even if you believe they dont care about palestinian children, for whatever reason, the PR alone is nightmare). Oh im sure theres the odd sociopath in there who might enjoy killing, but most of the soldiers (and former soldiers) ive met are very well grounded people who dont get off on killing. the IDF even allows their soldiers to disobey direct orders if they believe them to be morally wrong. I know of no other military that allows this. This is because of the ""we were just following orders"" defense at the nuremberg trials. The israeli govt wanted to ensure that if a soldier got an order they thought was wrong (like ""blow up that school full of kids"") they could just say ""no""

Yet Hamas leadership have no trouble using this tactic. The more children they put in harms way the better they look and theyll continue using this disgusting tactic as long as people blame israel for the deaths. the best way to stop it? put the blame where it belongs, on Hamas. By blaming israel you allow this to continue and you ensure that there will be more children dead

&#x200B;

Most palestinians and arabs in general know Hamas doesnt give a shit about palestinians (if you honestly think they do then youre just as brainwashed as those poor kids who grow up with dreams of dying for a bullshit cause), yet the antizionist lot tend to argue that theyre just ""freedom fighters"" doing what they have to. Sorry but no, freedom fighters try to preserve the life of their people, especially their children! they dont put them in harms way while they run and hide. Thats what a terrorist does.

&#x200B;

191tlj7,“Indigenous” claims on both sides are irrelevant. Israel has a clear legal and moral right to exist,"The entire “who’s more indigenous” debate is a distraction to make cloudy what’s crystal clear.

On May 14, 1948, Mandatory Palestine was dissolved and the land was stateless. At that moment in time, no sovereign state existed, Arab or Jewish. Therefore, regardless of ancestral or ""indigenous"" claims, all ethnic groups legally residing in former Mandatory Palestine were equally entitled to the right to self-determination on their own slice of the land.

Whether or not all 600,000 Jews arrived the day before on boats from Brooklyn or every Palestinian Arab family lived there for 16,000 years is irrelevant and arbitrary. On that date in 1948, 600,000 Jews were residing there on land legally purchased and thus had the right to carve out their own part of former Mandatory Palestine and declare their sovereignty.

Arabs should’ve established their own state but instead tried to block the Jews by refusing any attempt at partition. Arabs had no legal nor moral standing to suppress Jewish self-determination by demanding that all of former British Mandatory Palestine remain a single Arab-majority state.

There were approximately 2 million people in all of Mandatory Palestine at the time. Today, the land hosts nearly 20 million people. There was no practical justification for 1.3 million Arabs to try to stretch out their arms as wide as possible and claim all of the land, inhabited and uninhabited, for their own single state when there was no pre-existing unified sovereign Arab state there and plenty of room to support a partition.

As soon as Jews expressed their desire to declare sovereignty and establish their own governance according to their own values, a single state was no longer an option.

COMMON ARGUMENTS

***\*There were several Arab-majority districts included in the Jewish state.***

One cannot invalidate the overall Jewish majority within the borders of the new Jewish state by pointing to pockets of Arab majority within it. First, the presence of pockets of Arab majorities in an overall Jewish majority state is no different than the presence of pockets of Jewish majorities in an overall Arab majority state. That rationale can be applied both ways; therefore, it cannot be used as a basis here.

Both sides can arbitrarily size up and down areas of focus to identify whatever pockets of majority they want. What’s not arbitrary is drawing borders that include as much of the Jewish population as possible while maintaining the overall natural Jewish majority within those lines.

**It is arbitrary and biased to say “majority rules” only in one case.** If the majority truly does rule in the case of an Arab majority in a single state, then it must also rule in the case of the 55%/45% natural overall Jewish majority within the borders of their own partitioned slice of former Mandatory Palestine.

***\*Jews stole the land on which they created Israel.***

Governance and sovereignty are not the same as private land ownership. Establishing a sovereign Jewish state did not inherently involve the ""theft of Arab lands."" The 1947 UN partition plan almost exclusively concerned governance and protected the private land property ownership rights of both Arabs and Jews.

&#x200B;

* No one would be forced to move or forfeit land.
* All residents would become full and equal citizens of the state they ended up in. No apartheid.
* If an Arab found themselves in the Jewish state, they had the option of switching their citizenship to the Arab state without having to move. Same offer to Jews in the Arab state.
* Freedom of travel between states was written into the plan, barring normal international security measures.
* The Jewish state was explicitly barred from confiscating land belonging to Arabs, and vice versa for the Arab state and Jewish residents.

Here is the actual 1947 UN plan in full.

[https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-185393/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-185393/)

This is the plan Arabs chose to reject with no counter. Arabs decided they would rather take their chances flatly refusing any sort of partition so that they could leverage their overall regional 2/3rds majority to force their will over the other 1/3rd.

The expulsion, fleeing, and loss of land of 700,000 Arabs were the direct and sole result of Arabs' decision to refuse the UN plan, choose violence, and initiate a war that they lost. The ""Nakba"" was a completely avoidable self-inflicted wound.

Furthermore, it happened in both directions. Whereas Israel refused right to return for national security reasons (as evidenced by the 160,000 Arabs who were allowed to stay and become Israeli citizens), Arabs performed an actual thorough ethnic cleansing on the lands they controlled by expelling or killing every Jew and confiscating or destroying all private Jewish-owned land in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and Gaza at the end of the war.

***\*The land split was unfair. Over 50% of the land went to the Jews.***

As mentioned above, sovereignty and private land ownership are different. Any Arab land ownership within the Jewish state was protected according to the UN plan.

One can go into the weeds of why the Jewish state received the allocation that it did.

* The borders were designed to capture as much of the Jewish population as possible while retaining the overall Jewish majority within them.
* It was expected that the Jewish population would increase significantly due to immigration spurred by its official status of the Jewish national home.
* Mandatory Palestine was originally 5 times larger than it was in 1948 and 80% of it was already given exclusively to the Arabs to form the Kingdom of Jordan/Transjordan.

However, that would be purely academic as **Arabs were not looking to negotiate borders**. They stated they would never support ANY partition. That's a stance they maintained throughout the existence of Mandatory Palestine (1920-1948), and arguably, to date.",08/01/24 19:29:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/191tlj7/indigenous_claims_on_both_sides_are_irrelevant/,140,385,960,Israeli,top,all

This included psychological abuse such as telling prisoners that Israel no longer existed, being repeatedly separated from family, branding, and according to other sources, being denied food and sustaining physical injuries.

I feel that it is problematic that many people are blatantly denying the abuse of hostages. It’s a sign that some are being influenced too strongly by the common public’s villainization of Israel. People notice the things Israel does wrong but are quick to refute any accusations against Hamas. This is a concerning pattern which I have noticed in many places as the media’s negative representation of Israel has its effect.

Hostages included adults and young children alike, and many of these choices were separated from their families. According to the article, there were even cases of children being separated from families, returned, and separated on repeat as a form of psychological torture.

I hope we can move past the denial of these horrors as a community. And I pray that we can find peace not only in Israel and Palestine but among ourselves by setting aside the biases that blind us.

1b44g41,As a Jew what does Israel do for me?,"Non-Israeli Jew here, I live in Canada.

Growing up I loved Israel. I was taught by my community that Israel was a wonderful country and something that all Jews should be proud of. That after the horrors of the Holocaust we had finally 'returned home' and had a place to call our own. I loved Israel so much that as a teenager I had plans to move to Israel (aliyah), learn Hebrew and join the IDF. I have cousins in Israel and visited the country many times.

But.

As I visited Israel more and more and started reading about Israeli history, particularly The Story of Israel by Martin Gilbert, I started to see things from a different perspective. I learned about the religious extremists in Israel, events like the bombing of the King David Hotel and Deir Yassin massacre, and the settlements. I watched as Israeli politics descended towards religious Zionism under Netanyahu's later years. I didn't move to Israel, and if I had may very well be serving in Gaza right now.

Israel was always presented by my community as an important country not just for the people living there, but for Jews more broadly. A particular line of reasoning is that Israel protects us from antisemitism, which is always lurking around the corner ready to strike. However, living in Canada and going around the world, I just don't see it. The antisemitism that exists is very minor, just mean comments, graffiti, nasty things said on the internet. Actual violence is very rare and is universally condemned by everyone around me. Compared to even one day of what Gaza is going through, antisemitism is just nothing of note. And where there is antisemitism... it always seems to come back to Israel. People hate Israel and because Israel is attached to us Jews, hate us. That's why antisemitism always spikes when there is something bad that Israel is doing or is perceived to be doing.

Israel doesn't protect us; we don't need Israel to be safe or prosperous. In fact, if you look at the most successful Jews in the world, people like Einstein, Larry David, Secretary Blinken, Mark Zuckerberg... most of them aren't Israeli. We thrive outside of Israel more than inside it. It feels like the Israeli Jews are an anchor dragging us down into their messy conflict, as opposed to the warm air underneath our wings.

Another reason we're supposed to support Israel is just that well, we're Jewish and they're Jewish; we're one people and should support each other. But I'm not convinced that such simple tribalism is a valid, especially with how difficult of a position this conflict puts us in. The fact is that aside from my cousins, I don't know any Israelis personally. They're all just as much strangers as the Palestinians. When I visited Israel, I didn't really feel like I belonged. I didn't speak Hebrew, I wasn't part of their culture, it was very much like I was a tourist. Being among Israelis doesn't feel like being among Jews in Canada or the US does. Are we really one people? Or maybe over the course of 70 years we've diverged like North and South Koreans have.

I'm very interested in replies from Israelis. Why should we support you? What do you do for us? Because you need us a lot more than we need you.",01/03/24 20:22:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1b44g41/as_a_jew_what_does_israel_do_for_me/,139,978,564,Israeli,top,all

17ibnik,"NYT: Hamas' stockpiles of fuel, food, water and medicine enough to keep fighting for months","A few excepts from an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/world/middleeast/palestine-gazans-hamas-food.html) by New York Times:

> Arab and Western officials say there is substance to Israeli claims of Hamas stockpiling supplies, including desperately needed food and fuel.

> Hamas has hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel for vehicles and rockets; caches of ammunition, explosives and materials to make more; and stockpiles of food, water and medicine, the officials said. A senior Lebanese official said Hamas, which is estimated to number between 35,000 and 40,000, had enough stocked away to keep fighting for three to four months without resupply.

> While the blockade has left Gaza’s roughly 2 million people scraping by with what little food and water they scrounge up, it does not yet appear to have begun to degrade Hamas’s ability to fight.

> Hamas has said little of its supply situation — combatants rarely do — but the government it runs in Gaza says it has an emergency fuel stockpile that is quickly being depleted. “Hospitals, the ambulances and fire fighters’ machinery and civil defense trucks have been using the government emergency fuel store,” said Salama Marouf, who runs the government’s media office in Gaza.

> Fuel has taken on growing importance in recent days. Israel has so far refused to allow any fuel to be delivered to Gaza, even as other aid begins to trickle in, leaving much of the enclave without electricity to power hospitals, desalinate or pump water, fire bakers’ ovens and run internet and cellphone services. The United Nations, which handles the bulk of humanitarian relief work in Gaza, said on Thursday that it “has almost exhausted its fuel reserves and begun to significantly reduce its operations.”",28/10/23 11:20:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17ibnik/nyt_hamas_stockpiles_of_fuel_food_water_and/,134,391,279,Israeli,top,all
nucmwm,Hamas’s forever war against Israel has a glitch,"Found [this article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamass-forever-war-against-israel-has-a-glitch-and-it-isnt-iron-dome/) interesting.

Basically it says that both sides fight to survive (that's how they see it). But there are two parts that I've found interesting:

Found the article Interesting. Here are a few facts from it

>Of course, none of that got in the way of Hamas [declaring and celebrating](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-claims-victory-as-palestinians-celebrate-after-first-night-of-calm/) its “victory” on Friday, using the term in the way pioneered by Hezbollah in 2006 that sees the mere fact of surviving a firefight with Israel, irrespective of the damage wrought to one’s country or the lack of damage inflicted on the enemy, as a “victory.” 

Seems like Hamas being ""victorious"" is simply it being alive

### 

And I've found this one humorous, Palestinian leaders never reveal that that's what they've been told (well, not being a totally free and transparent democracy)  

### ‘How do we expel the Jews?’

>In the mid-1990s, two IDF major generals were coming to the end of their long and storied military careers. Meir Dagan had led everything from commando squads to armored brigades and would later go on to serve as director of the Mossad. Yossi Ben Hanan, after serving as one of Israel’s most successful tank commanders in the 1973 war, would go on to lead the armored corps and the IDF’s R&D arm — though he is most famous for the 1967 Life magazine cover photo of his 22-year-old self standing in the waters of the Suez Canal, a symbol of Israeli vitality and military success.  
>  
>By the mid-1990s, the two grizzled veterans, newly released from their military duties, planned to travel together to Vietnam. Both were avid students of military history, including of the Vietnam conflict. They applied for visas and made a special request to the Vietnamese authorities: to meet General Vo Nguyen Giap.  
>  
>Giap was one of the great strategic minds of the twentieth century, a former schoolteacher who played a central role in developing the strategic thinking and organizational capabilities that transformed ragtag rural provincials into a military force that would rout the most powerful nations in the world, from the Japanese occupation to the French and the Americans over three long decades of conflict culminating in the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.  
>  
>Giap was also a ruthless and often tyrannical leader, murdering opponents of Vietnam’s communist movement and overseeing a guerrilla war that sacrificed hundreds of thousands of his own fighters to the cause. He was no hero to the Israelis, but he nevertheless cut a fascinating figure in the annals of modern warfare.  
>  
>Unexpectedly, the request was approved. Giap agreed to meet them. When the Israelis arrived in Vietnam, they sat down with the man who by then had spent decades as his country’s defense minister. It was a long meeting, as Ben Hanan would later recall to Eran Lerman, a former top-ranked IDF intelligence officer and later deputy national security adviser. Lerman, now at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, told the story to this writer.  
>  
>When the Israelis rose to leave, Giap suddenly turned to the Palestinian issue. “Listen,” he said, “the Palestinians are always coming here and saying to me, ‘You expelled the French and the Americans. How do we expel the Jews?’”  
>  
>The generals were intrigued. “And what do you tell them?”  
>  
>“I tell them,” Giap replied, “that the French went back to France and the Americans to America. But the Jews have nowhere to go. You will not expel them.”

1bnr3e8,Hamas and some Pro-Palestinians are happy to sacrifice civilians for nothing more than PR points,"With word breaking that Hamas has rejected yet another ceasefire - this one for 6 weeks that would see the return of 40 hostages for 700 prisoners - it's clear that Hamas has no interest in any type of deal whatsoever. In a similiar vein, everyone demanding a ceasefire makes no mention of Hamas' constantly rejecting ceasefire offers that would result in calm for weeks at a time.

Meanwhile, this means an operation into Rafah is inevitable, which Sinwar is happy about. Not too long ago, word emerged that Sinwar's strategy is to maintain this conflict as long as possible because as civillian casualties mount, international pressure mounts on Israel. If this seems bleak and nonsensical to western ears, keep in mind that Hamas culture glorifies martydom - which is why you see kids in Hamas run schools acting out killing jews in school plays to crowds of cheering parents.

It is perhaps unprecedented in major war to have one side completely willing to sacrifice it's own people solely to generate PR talking points.

Meanwhile, as Israel urges people in Gaza to move out of a war zone, pro-palestinians in the west decry it as ethnic cleansing and are vehmently opposed to it. Perhaps there is a new definition, but having Palestinians move to another area WITHIN Gaza doesn't constitute ethnic cleansing. 

In this respect, it seems too that Palestinian supporters are also willing to sacrifice civillians for PR points. I still find it somewhat jarring that when I advocate palestinian civillians move to a safe area - no different than over half a million israelis who are currently displaced - I'm met with nothing but hate.",25/03/24 22:24:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bnr3e8/hamas_and_some_propalestinians_are_happy_to/,135,338,277,Israeli,top,all
18hdgyf,WSJ: Israel has started pumping Seawater into Gaza Tunnels,"
*Disclaimer: I‘m generally pro Israel but not without limits. My country supports Israel but we don’t know how far Israel might go. Its always a very difficult balance act. I definitely recognize Israels right to defend itself and condemn Islamists in every way*

Source: 
https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-war-pumping-seawater-gaza-tunnels-2ed3b3f2

*Israel’s military has begun pumping seawater into Hamas’s vast complex of tunnels in Gaza, according to U.S. officials briefed on the Israeli military’s operations, part of an intensive effort to destroy the underground infrastructure that has underpinned the group’s operations.*

**Now it has begun. Israel started pumping seawater.**

The question remains: How will this effect Gaza longterm, if thousands of gallons of seawater gets pumped under the city? Might buildings collapse when the water soggs through the ground? Might crops fail if the earth gets too salty? Might there be a contamination of the groundwater?

I just ask cause it seems like no one wants to take the Palestinians as refugees, not even their arab allies, so we need to talk about the future of Gaza, the future after Hamas is gone. 

Without a perspective this conflict will never end. And after Israel retreated there needs to be some kind of marshal plan. Vast areas are completely destroyed, there are no houses where people could return to, the infrastructure is gone and food supplies ran out. They cant just retreat and leave people in refugee camps. 

So yes, Israel has every right to wipe Hamas off the face of this earth, but there needs to be a solution for the civilians.",13/12/23 09:59:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18hdgyf/wsj_israel_has_started_pumping_seawater_into_gaza/,137,1180,256,Israeli,top,all

I go to a bnei akiva yeshiva, which is the largest chain of Zionist yeshivas in Israel. We study religious texts and halacha but also normal subjects, like English, math and science.

In Israel, unlike the USA, there is no ban on schools for certain religions. What I mean is that a yeshiva can be a public school, even though it is religious. You would also study the Quran in Arab schools.

Around a week ago we had a discussion in class about naturei karta - a fringe extremist group of antizionist ultra-orthodox. Their main claim is that the country of Israel was created and functions as a Satan to the people of Israel. The teacher explained how that cannot be correct according to Judaism.  Then a student asked if Arabs are a Satan. I was very surprised by this question due to it's obvious racist background. The teacher asked what he meant. The kid said ""look what they do to us"".

o0dwem,"Eight Centrist, Pragmatic Steps","Thanks to a post by u/Amit_Shraibhand, I recently read an [article in the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/eight-steps-shrink-israeli-palestinian-conflict/585964/) that was so pragmatic and intelligent that I felt moved to raise it to the community again. I think it's absolutely phenomenal. We've been in absolute deadlock on this issue for the better part of a generation, and it seems to me (and to the author) that all the 'big bang' solutions to the problem seem to be interminably stalled, and more or less in deadlock.

The article provides a set of steps that Israel could take more or less unilaterally to *reduce the size* of the conflict and create a wealthier, more peaceful, more independent Palestine, without risking Israel's security.

For those who didn't read the article, here's a brief rundown on the main points:

* **Keep It Flowing:** Infrastructure investments to create Palestinian controlled highways, tunnels and bridges to allow for Palestinian cities to be connected via Palestinian infrastructure without creating security threats to settlements. This would virtually eliminate the lockdowns and checkpoints that characterize the occupation for Palestinians in the West Bank.
* **Expand Areas A/B:** Because transferring Area C is supposed to be part of a peace settlement, Areas A/B have stayed the same size while the Palestinian population hasn't. Transfer chunks of Area C to Palestinian control to allow for population expansion.
* **Logistics for Arab Travel from East Jerusalem:** Build a secure terminal at Ben Gurion and direct shuttle from East Jerusalem to allow Arabs in East Jerusalem to travel more freely; modernize and streamline border crossings into Jordan.
* **Expand employment in Israel:** The IDF estimates employment of WB Palestinians in Israel could be ramped from 150K to over 400K without any risk to security. This would increase contact and dramatically improve prosperity for over a million Palestinians.
* **Land reallocation:** An Israeli think tank has proposed a plan in which large sections of Area C are immediately dedicated to economic development (think industrial parks, manufacturing, etc) and international investment, with Palestinian employees, owners, etc.
* **No settlement expansion:** Pretty self-explanatory.
* **Give the West Bank a port:** Hamas's control over Gaza has created a long-term blockade; the IDF's plan envisions a dedicated Palestinian terminal at Haifa, and secure shipping centers at the border crossing where freight can be inspected for explosives, etc before locking the shipping crate and sending it directly to the port. That'd allow the WB to export much, much more cheaply than it does now.
* **Economic independence:** Reverse the Paris Protocol and allow the Palestinians to control their own tax, import, export, and customs.

None of these things solves the root problem, brings about peace, or is 'philosophically' legitimate -- but, taken together, they vastly improve the Palestinian economy, create significantly more independence, reverse the momentum behind annexation, create more economic interdependence between Israel and Palestine, and would vastly reduce the size of the conflict.

All without requiring anyone to take a big leap of faith.

18dskxe,Why does UN ask Israel to do a ceasefire while no ask to Hamas to release all hostages for peace?,"I am baffled at this ! as UN, you must strive for peace and reduce human deaths, but why only Palestinian deaths are more important than Israeli deaths?

Ask to Palestinians, before you ask for Israel to stop bombarding on morality, is it not your first responsibility to release their hostages? basically, you kidnap your neighbour's child and when he comes to find his kid with a weapon, you ask him to be morally upright and do nothing for his kid? Release hostages first before asking the world to help you on moral grounds.

And if you are saying hostages are justified because Israel first did this and so and so going till 1948, why bother asking the world even? you want to continue the cycle of violence, just continue and don't beg the world to put pressure on Israel

what about the UN? if the UN is saying holding hostages is justified because of the previous violence cycles, then Israel has every right to create new violence cycle, since their people are hostages now.

UN being a neutral body must clearly give their stand on Oct 7. If Oct 7 is wrong, then Hamas must give up all hostages and ask for trial ( may not be trial in Israel but by UN). If oct 7 is justified based on previous violence cycle by Israel, then Israel has all the right to create similar Oct 7s on Gaza.

va5o6x,"“I have no problem with Jews or Israelis, just those Zionists!”","Too often I’ve heard this exact statement. 
I found most people don’t even know what Zionism means, they think it’s “illegal settlers” or some weird Illuminati-esque cult (old Jews run the world trope?). While yes, settlers are Zionists, they are not all or even most Zionists. A Zionist is just someone who believes Jews should have a country. Today that country is Israel. Most Zionists want to coexist. 

Throughout history antisemitism has been obsessed with insisting that Jews are a race of people. So after thousands of years of being treated like dirt around the world, Zionism came about to say “hey maybe we need our own country”. Zionism is the pragmatic solution to the oldest hate; that solution, a Jewish state. There are official Christian countries, official Muslim countries, even official Buddhist countries, so there’s movement for there to be ONE Jewish country. That movements name is Zionism. Yea it’s far from perfect, still Zionism is the only logical answer to millennia of persecution, and still it’s demonized.

Being against Jewish self determination in the form of an independent country is anti-Zionism. If you are anti-Zionist, you are by definition anti-Israel and in effect anti-Jew because to destroy Israel would be to throw the Jews back to the diaspora where history has taught us… they will be persecuted. As we see, history does repeat itself, people are no more enlightened or better today than they were 100 years ago; we’re the same beast. 

It’s okay to seriously disagree with Israeli policy, but you can’t say you’re anti-Zionist but not anti-Semitic. You can still be anti-Zionist, but it is a package deal with anti-semitism.

But there have been zero, outright condemnations from the Muslim world. 

Instead, the day after the grisly murders there were “pro-Palestine” rallies; but Gaza wasn’t attacked, the Jews were. So the really felt like pro-Hamas, pro-hate, pro-murder rallies.

Here is the support for that claim: The rally in NYC, they chanted “700.” That’s how many Jews were confirmed murdered at the time. So they were HAPPY that 700 people were murdered? Sounds like it.

In Australia the “pro-Palestinian” “rally” they chanted “gas the Jews.” That doesn’t seem peaceful at all.

Before Gaza was attacked, but on the day of the murders, most large cities in the Muslim world displayed some type of solidarity with the Palestinians. So they had time to condemn the violence and Hamas but they didn’t.

17riad8,"""From the river to the sea"" is antisemetic. Period. If you disagree, consider this perspective....","I'm tired of people defending using the slogan ""From the river to the sea"".

Instead of restating the normal arguments for why it is, like the history of it, the use by Hamas, the overt explanations over decades of what it means, the original translation, etc. I want to try to explain it from a different perspective that may help people understand why it is antisemetic.

Regardless of whether you believe all of the points for why it is antisemetic, it is antisemetic to a vast majority of Jewish people. We are a minority with a LONG history of being persecuted, murdered, genocided, and hated. We have seen a continued streak of antisemetic attacks, including a Jewish man murdered by a protestor the other day in America.

How symbols make a minority group feel is important, similar to the confederate flag. To many people in the south, it is a symbol of their culture and pride, however it is widely regarded to be a symbol of racism, both because of its history and how it makes black people feel.If you can understand that, and think that people shouldn't be marching down the street waiving a confederate flag, why can you not understand why people shouldn't be marching down the street saying ""From the river to the sea"". **When you are arguing with a Jewish person that it isn't antisemetic, take a step back for a second, and recognize that you are doing the same thing as people in the American south trying to convince a black person that waiving the confederate flag isn't racist.**

All I said was “a customer came into my work today and I asked where he was from and he said Palestine.” She snapped  “that’s funny, because Palestine isn’t a thing”. 

Idk, I wasn’t trying to trigger or spark any kind of inflammatory response. I was just stating what happened at work. 

I didn’t know she was Zionist before this but regardless if she is or not, I feel like you could’ve just said “oh what else did he say” or “how long has he been here” “is his family here too” etc.. 

It’s just weird to me someone can believe that a Palestinian doesn’t exist. Just completely deny someone’s existence or identity. I also don’t think there’s anything “funny” about any of this.

17d5fva,Why is Zionism considered evil?,"I’m a Jew, born in USSR and raised in America.

I would read about the nationalisms in the late 1800s, of the Balkan people vs the Austrian-Hungarians, the Irish vs the English, Poles vs Russians, etc. it was kind of idealized in the textbooks, and Zionism was just the Jewish form of that late 1800s trend of nationalism (spurred by horrendous pohgroms in Russian Empire, Arab lands, etc.). 

So through my family I understood the struggle Jews have been through throughout the ages. I thoroughly enjoy understanding how Zionists would meet in European cities and plan the creation of a Jewish state and created funds to buy land in Palestine from Ottomans and Arabs and then from the British as well. And the plans for building the great city - Tel Aviv. All super interesting. I mean it’s a small piece of land, we wanted just half of that piece, and all parties involved seem to believe in the Old Testament, so buying the land and building towns that didn’t exist before should be acceptable to the local population under Ottoman rule. I mean it was going to be around Jerusalem regardless, Jews weren’t gonna build Zion in Alaska, Siberia or Madagascar, that wouldn’t make sense at all to the Zionists. 

In my opinion, I don’t see anything inherently sinister or malevolent about Zionism. And I truly believe there would be no extremists within the Zionists if only the two state solution had been agreed to in 1948 by Palestinians and the Arab league. 

Let me know your thoughts. Let’s have a healthy conversation about Zionism.",21/10/23 15:44:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17d5fva/why_is_zionism_considered_evil/,170,1330,266,Palestine,top,all
1806vsr,Can we dispatch with this genocide claim? Muslims in Palestine have quadrupled since 1945,"There is a bad habit in the pro-Palestinian side to redefine words, theories,ideas, crimes to make it fit this war or conflict and make Zionists look worst. One of which fixation with accusing Israel of Genocide. Look has Israel committed war crimes in the past? Yes. So did everyone in the 40s decade. 


But genocide? There is no genocide. During the 1931 census of Mandatory Palestine the British saw about 1.2 million residents of which .8 Million were Muslims by 1945/8 the estimate was a 1.8 million population with 1.2 being Muslims. Since the founding of Israel the theory goes Israel has carried ethnic cleansings and genocide against Palestinians. However any good google search reveals that claim as wrong. In Gaza there are 1.2 million to maybe 1.8 million Palestinians of Muslim faith  the West Bank has somewhere between 2 or more million Palestinians. All of this while living under war and occupation from people doing acts of genocide against them.


How can a population of maybe 1.2 million, more than Quadruple under a genocidal occupation over 7 decades? 


The Austrian Painter reject in 3 years killed 6 million Jews 


The Ottoman Turks are believed to have killed 1 million Armenians in a year

184hpel,"Being pro-palestine doesn't make you anti-semitic, but it does let you get away with anti-semitism","I do not believe being pro-palestine means you are necessarily anti-semitic. Criticism of a government is not anti-semitic. I do think that a strong component of anti-zionsim is anti-semitism, but that is a separate discussion.

I have noticed, however, that a lot of anti-semites use pro-palestinian sentiment to justify anti-semitism. For instance, people online justifying the holocaust ""because palestine"" or people touting anti-semitic conspiracy theories in these discussions. I saw a tweet threatening to rip off Noah Schnapps nose (I'm sure I do not need to explain why that is anti-semitic) There were those protests in Australia where they chanted gas the Jews. Jewish schools in my country have even been subject to bomb threats, in the name of Palestine. People have vandalized jewish cemeteries. Pro-palestine protestors will deliberately protest in jewish neighborhoods or outisde of Jewish buildings like synagogues or jewish owned businesses, just because jewish people are there. People will either ignore this behavior or support it, all on the grounds of the perpetrator being pro-palestine. I also want to address the people who say they can't be anti-semitic because they themselves  are semitic. This claim is just disingenuous. It just ignores the definition of anti-semitism. This is purely semantics that people use to justify their anti-semitism. Also, the fact that some jews are pro-palestine does not mean that no pro-palestine people are anti-semitic.

In my opinion, if you are pro-palestine, it is your responsibility to point out anti-semitism from people who claim to be pro-palestine and disassociate yourself from it, just as I believe it is my responsibility to call out prejudice from people who claim to be pro-israel.

kwjmw0,Palestinian YouTube stars harass Jews in Belgium,"The latest example of antisemitism at the hands of Middle Eastern immigrants in Europe comes from Belgium. Two Palestinian twins, asylum seekers from Gaza, had decided that antisemitic harassment of Hasidic communities is hilarious. Harassing Jews for being Jews gives the giggles to the 10 million followers of the twins, who’ve liked the video. 

Riding rollers through a Jewish quarter guarded by the Belgic military, due to repeated violent attacks by Muslim immigrants (most notably two terror attacks by Islamic state followers in the last few years) and carrying Palestinian flags they’ve decided to skate over to the “Jewish neighbourhood” and storm random Jews, which they’ve successfully identified through their traditional Hasidic garb. Genius... 

Cycling up aggressively towards unsuspecting Hasidic Jews minding their own business in their own neighbourhood, the 2 Gazans stormed Hasidic Jews with cameras, demanding they proclaim their loyalty to Palestine. At times they were filmed pushing random Hasidic men... Nothing to see there. Nearly every Jewish looking man in Europe has been randomly pushed or spat on by a passerby. 

The embarrassed Hasidic Jews, who don’t even speak English and who’re not Zionist, sheepishly turned them down. Unfortunately, such dehumanising harassment is too common for these poor people. But no matter how many times they’re publicly mocked, murdered, spat on or beaten by their neighbours,  antisemitic humiliation is something they’ll never get used to, despite being a daily occurrence that’s been closely woven into their daily lives (for centuries). 

This expression of antisemitism was relatively benign. The Palestinian trolls were generally non violent. Except recklessly skating at high speed towards teenage Jewish girls coming back from synagogue and ramming into a Hasidic man, they hardly physically attacked anyone. So the Belgium Jewish community’s response to the incident was relatively subdued. The authorities, of course, do nothing. The Palestinians had passed through Belgium army patrols without even raising an eyebrow. This is a sad state of affairs for Europe that blatant racist harassment merits such soft response. Unfortunately, the Belgium Jewish community is so used to violence and terrorism, that semi violent antisemitism just doesn’t cut it. 

At this point, only actual murder and assault of Jews merit attention. Note that even in cases of violence by Muslims targeting Jews in Europe, the benefit of the doubt is always extended to the attackers. European authorities, and some Americans as well (such as a prominent Biden appointee) are highly reluctant to label such attacks as being motivated by antisemitism.

17xhomn,Was banned from another sub for this post. Would love to hear your thoughts.,"Preface: This is a rant I posted somewhere else and was almost immediately banned. A lot of the below is anger laden (I have pre 48 Palestinian heritage, the topic is very emotional for me), but still would love to hear your thoughts and how this sub ticks regarding this topic.

I joined here because I thought this sub is a good mix of educated people from MENA and also other places on earth. I found some nice nuanced takes here, sometimes very controversial stuff but it was niche.

Before I start my rant that will follow now: I am strongly condemning the bombing of civilians, hospitals and schools happening in Gaza right now. I feel indescribable rage when I see the kids that lost their families only to hear some a_holes on here saying that it’s deserved because of Hamas. F_ck them justifying the killing of innocents.

Now having said that, I also hate Hamas, because they are constantly doing futile bullsh_t attacks on civilians and invite the IDF over to do their mass killings in Gaza. I can totally understand the young people joining them and I can understand the Palestinians that do support them - they’re doing it as a result of traumatic experiences that no one of us on this platform can understand.

What I cannot understand however is how people on this sub, mostly living comfortable lives, eating good food, having jobs and potentially partner and kids and beds to sleep in at night, come here and fucking praise Hamas. What the f_ck is wrong with you? What have you lost that you support people killing innocents? I can understand them doing it, they’re traumatised and just want revenge. But you? You a_holes have no right to defend this! You’re criticising the IDF because they kill innocents and then you praise Hamas? You guys are constantly complaining how the west says that “I support Palestine” = “I love Hamas”. But if they go on this sub this is exactly what they will see. You guys downvote a video of a Palestinian, a man who probably just lost loved ones while you were drinking green tea with nana, because he criticised Hamas.",17/11/23 15:33:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17xhomn/was_banned_from_another_sub_for_this_post_would/,161,383,366,Palestine,top,all

i do not speak arabic so i would appreciate if someone told me if the Post's translation is accurate. 

but i would like to hear from the palestinians and pro palestinians on here, what do you think of this guy? what do you think of what he says? do you agree with him or do you, like me, think this guy should go with netanyahu to hell. 

these are the kind of leaders we need to get rid off on both sides if we want an end to this conflict. 

i am for israel existing, but i am not for the continued oppression of palestinians, but so long as palestinians help people who commit crimes like the two who ran over 17 people (not saying any did in this incident just an example) and do not actively participate in fighting this insane people, there isnt much anyone like me can do to say that safety can be achieved without the oppression. anything i would say would be drowned out. 

and it all starts by accepting one thing. israel is here to stay. you can work with it, or you can ignore it for the most part, but it is a fact that it is here to stay. and working against it in the long run hurts both sides.

The article,

A leader and founding member of Hamas, Khalid Mashal, reportedly called for a global Jon Tuesday, asking Muslims around the world to target the people of Israel on Friday, Oct. 13.

This is breaking news that will be updated as more information becomes available. Keep reading below.

Video of Mashal’s reported call to violence was posted on YouTube and remains up on the platform as of Wednesday at 10 a.m.

According to a translation and analysis of the video by author Brother Rachid, Mashal referred to his proposed day of anger as “the Friday of Al-Aqsa flood,” which will “send a message of rage to Zionists and to America.”

“The most important thing: He asked all Muslims around the world to carry Jihad by their souls; to fight and be martyrs for Al-Aqsa. He wants Muslims to fight against the Jews, starting with Muslims who live in the countries surrounding Israel: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt (but also other countries), to go to the borders and try to enter, each by his own means,” Rachid explained. “He said: This is the time for Jihad to be applied on the ground rather than just in theory. He asked the Mujahedeen to go in long caravans to spell their blood on the land of Palestine.”

“Funds are important but today we are asking for your blood and souls \[to be sacrificed for Palestine\],” Mashal concluded, according to Rachid. /endarticle.

I guess we'll know pretty soon how far this thing can escalate.  If Muslims start rushing towards Israel, and attacking people in different countries, we may have another big problem on our hands.

1750di8,Why do socialists and leftists feel the need to defend the actions of Hamas ?,"Every single post I’ve seen on Reddit about the conflict in far left groups is pro Palestine and often pro Hamas. 
This conflict really made me realize how vicious and misguided some members of the far left are. They call Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East, a fascist regime. They say Israel is genocidal even though Hamas, an organization that has actually advocated for genocide, is comprised of”reedom fighters”. 

Of course Israel has made mistakes and committed human rights violations. But defending Hamas is honestly ridiculous and evil. Defend the rights of innocent Palestinians but not their evil government. Every far left group on Reddit has done this to some extent. I think it’s partially because they see everything through a Marxist lense. The more powerful nation is always the oppressor even though Israel has always fired back in retaliation. Honestly ideological biases can be detrimental to rational thought.

>Republican US presidential candidate Nikki Haley says Egypt as well as “pro-Hamas countries” Qatar, Iran and Turkey should take in Palestinians trying to flee the war in Gaza.

>But I’ve always said that what you should have is that they should go to pro-Hamas countries — Qatar, Iran, Turkey… send them there… Those are pro-Hamas countries.

>Why isn’t everybody talking to Egypt? Why aren’t they talking to Turkey? Why aren’t they talking to Qatar? Why aren’t they talking to Iran? Why aren’t they doing something to help the Palestinians? Why is it that you come back to Israel and the US? It’s always the case.

>“If [the October 7 attack] had happened to America, do you not think that we would have hit back?” asks Haley.

1. Do you agree with Nikki Haley that Qatar, Iran and Turkey are pro-Hamas countries ?

2. Do you agree with Nikki Haley that pro-Hamas countries should take in Gaza refugees ?

3. Why is it always Israel and the US to solve the Palestine problem ? Why cant the regional countries step up to help solve the Palestine problem ?

4. This is the season of US presidential campaign, this is part of Nikki Haley’s campaign speech. How exactly is anyone suppose to get these pro-Hamas countries to take in Gaza refugees ? Some of the leaders in these countries have already stated at the very beginning of the war that they will not be accepting Gaza refugees. What leverage does anyone have over these countries which could help change their mind to accept Gaza refugees fleeing war ? Does the world need to offer cash assistance to host countries like they did to Turkey for hosting 4 million Syrian refugees, EU paid Turkey € 6 billion. 

5. How about we help people of Gaza who voluntarily want to leave Gaza be able to do so and send them to host countries which are currently willing to accept Gaza refugees fleeing the war. I can think of Scotland, Ireland and Malaysia, I am sure there are more.

177j1k9,I don't hate you all.,"I have seen what Hamas is doing, and what is being done to Palestine. I am a Jew by blood, and even have family/friends who live in Israel. So this does affect me personally, not just on a human level, but on a familial one.

Many Jews are now saying ""may Palestine burn"" and ""kill every one of those pigs"" (usually meant for just Hamas, but sometimes for all Palestinians). Many Jews now look at Gaza with even more animosity. Many will never be able to forgive the entirety of Palestine for what has been happening.

To my innocent Jewish brothers and sisters, I am so sorry for what we are going through due to the barbarism and selfishness of Hamas. And to all innocent Palestinians, I am so sorry for what you are going through. Please know, I do not wish you harm, but only peace.

These events have been heartbreaking to all involved and all who watch from elsewhere. No one is truly innocent. No one has zero blood on their hands. What Hamas has done is unforgivable, but that is merely Hamas, not the Palestinian or Muslim populace as a whole.

1arj6ti,We REALLY need more nuance in discussions surrounding war crimes/deaths,"I'll start by saying: I'm pro-Israel. Not anti-Palestine by any means, but someone who supports Israel and is in favor of a two-state solution (feel free to look through my post history if you for some reason don't believe me). That being said, it's clear that thousands of Palestinians have died in this war, which is obviously tragic. And the problem is, there is absolutely zero nuance in the online discourse that discusses these deaths/crimes, because a lot of the time, it is possible that there is a lot of missing context in these stories.

Whenever footage of Palestinian deaths/IDF crimes emerges on the internet (and there's been a lot of disturbing ones these past few days), there's this annoying dichotomy that exists in the discourse, which splits between:

""Look at Israel doing all these atrocious things as they always do, therefore screw everything about them and I have no sympathy for anyone who lives there""

and

""Well what do you expect to happen in a war? Everyone in Gaza voted for Hamas so they deserve it anyway"" OR ""It's probably fake and all Hamas propaganda anyway""

We need more discourse that focuses on:

* Giving context as to why/how some of these atrocities happen in war
* Accepting that the IDF has done some unconscionable things and how they can take accountability for it
* In some cases, when necessary, accept that some of the footage released *could* be taken very out of context and may not *always* be what it appears to be

There's been annoyingly little nuance when talking about war crimes that have happened and it feels like everything comes down to either ""Israel sucks, dismantle them"" or ""Everyone in Gaza deserves it and it's all fake anyway"".

I understand this sub leans more pro-Israel, and as an Israel supporter I obviously don't have a problem with this. But, I think whenever someone brings up a death/war crime caused by Israel, it's immediately downvoted, denied, or justified. And those exact types of reactions are what cause so much vitriol towards Israel supporters in the first place, because it makes us look really heartless.

And then of course on other subs, there are people who hate everything about Israel and its supporters, think Hamas is justified in their actions, and refuse to converse with anyone who has any sympathy for Israel whatsoever. I am never going to attempt to talk to people like this, because they have no interest in talking to me or hearing my thoughts. But I *do* want to be able to have discussions with people somewhere in the middle; who are more sympathetic to Palestine, without justifying Hamas. That's what I feel like the whole point of this sub is, but instead of having civilized discussions, there's this annoying dichotomy in the discourse in which everyone on the sub is fighting each other and calling each other names.",15/02/24 16:18:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1arj6ti/we_really_need_more_nuance_in_discussions/,132,408,485,Palestine,top,all
shzh36,Peace was never an option,"Hello everyone

I'm a Palestinian living abroad. Although I'm not very active on this sub I like to come in here and read some of the discussions from time to time, as well as read discussions about the conflict elsewhere. I've always been curious as to whether I'm going to see an end to it in my lifetime or not. 

People on both sides as well as leaders/politicians have discussed the prospect of peace before, but it never really got to anywhere. Both sides seem to blame the other for it, with each side being fully convinced that they are in the right and the other are in the wrong. This doesn't just apply to discussions about peace, just about the conflict in general. We may have been ignoring this for so long, but let's be real: if you are Palestinian/Israeli, and you are discussing the conflict with an Israeli/Palestinian, are you trying to have a civil discussion where you try to understand where the other person is coming from? Or are you doing your best to ""win"" the discussion?

Growing up, I was taught about the conflict from the Palestinian perspective (obviously) and I fully believed that Jews have no right to be in Palestine, not because I was anti-Semitic but because I thought having ancestors living in a land 2000 years ago is not a strong enough reason. Then, Jews wanted to create their own country within our land. That, along with the Nakba and everything that happened after, made Israel the enemy of the people. As a kid, I even remember thinking something along with lines of: ""How can an entire nation argue that they are in the right when the facts obviously show they are in the wrong here? There's not much room for twisting the facts, they came here in the 20th century, killed my people and kicked them out of their homes"". I think the Palestinian perspective is missed by most Israelis; we are not a barbaric group of anti-Semitic people who don't like seeing Jews succeed, and we are not part of a collective Arab/Muslim population in that we can just get over the conflict and go to some other Arab/Muslim country. We are humans, and our reasons for feeling aggrieved are just. Replace Palestinians with any group of people in the world and they would feel the same, replace Israelis with any group of people in the world and we would still feel the same. 

From the other perspective, Jews have seen extreme hardships (I know that is understating it) in Europe and on a smaller scale in the Middle East. They had a vision through Zionism that would see them live in their own land, safe and secure. Obviously, Palestinians don't agree with Zionism, specifically when it states that the homeland should be in Palestine, and that is a topic of discussion between the two sides. Discussing it doesn't matter - it won't change a thing about today nor the future. WW2 and the holocaust happened and those changed everything. I think it's important to think about the average Jew's mental state at this point. If any person is placed in a situation where they or their families are in danger, they disregard other people's wants and needs, and maybe even safety, to ensure their own or their families' safety. That is human nature. The mentality was probably carried over to Palestine and Palestinians were probably viewed as merely an anti-Semitic people who were standing in their way to security. I may not have expanded on the Israeli perspective much, but I hope I got the message across. The situation isn't what the majority of Palestinians think, and should we replace Israelis with any other group of people in the world, they would do exactly what the Israelis did.

Let's go back to discussing the possibility of peace. Obviously, every one wants it if it's ensured to be (seemingly) perpetual. Obviously, this isn't the case. There's a risk to be incurred and compromises to be made by the Israeli side if there is to be peace, including losing the grip on control of what goes into or out of the hands of Palestinians, which is used to ensure weapons don't go through. Israelis would probably have to give up their control of most the West Bank, too. If an Israeli doesn't believe that peace would be upheld, then they wouldn't think that the risk is worth taking because it would affect their security. On the Palestinian side, we would have to compromise on what we believe is our right in order for there to be peace. That is mainly giving up on the right of return. However, this is something you can never go back on if agreed upon, and Palestinians, like Israelis, would also be cynical about how long peace would last. 

My point here is, before discussing what peace should look like, try to imagine if it's possible to get there. I know I can't. From the day the conflict started until today, peace never would've been successful. It's like putting two starving dogs in a cage and expecting them to be nice to each other. Both sides distrust each other so much that it is hard to compromise their own positions for what they think would be a failed plan. Peace requires compromise from both ends, otherwise it would sound more like extortion. The reason why the distrust exists is because each side sees the other as the villain. So instead of talking about a fair solution, we should be talking about a realistic one.

We shouldn't talk about a solution that should be implemented in the present time, because that's never going to work, no matter what you try. A two state solution, a one state solution, a federation - neither will work today nor would've worked in the past. I believe the only way to make peace possible is to plan for it, some 30-40 years down the line. You need a new generation that isn't affected by the hate and prejudice of the previous generations. If you don't think that can happen, then don't discuss peace - it's a fairytale. I think if you were truly looking for peace, then that's the way you should think, because today's population aren't going to compromise anything, they're too affected by what happened to their previous generations. If you think changing entire mindsets is difficult, yes it is. Just as difficult as solving this conflict.

TLDR; Peace never happened because both sides believe the other side is evil, and therefore neither would ever compromise for peace. If you want peace, pray that the coming generations are smarter than the passing ones, and that they would be able to see what got us into this mess.",01/02/22 16:48:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/shzh36/peace_was_never_an_option/,131,195,1137,Palestine,top,all
18mudtc,Everyone has it wrong this war is not about Palestine,"Everyone thinks this is a battle between Israel and Hamas over land. It is not. It is a much bigger war between Iran and its allies Russia, China, Qatar etc vs USA and its allies in the west, Egypt etc for who will get the Saudis and India on their side. That’s what the Abraham accords was all about and Iran sacrificed its pawn in Hamas to try and stop it. Hamas is almost done and probably will be. The Saudis are monitoring how strong Israel is and Israel must win for Saudis to trust Israeli strength (this is what Israel brings to the table). Iran sent the Houthi’s to hurt Egypt by blocking the canal where the Egyptians make a ton of money. The Egyptians also want the Abraham accords to continue and Hamas eradicated.

It looks like this will succeed. Hamas is almost done. Iran did not want to sacrifice their knight (Hezbollah) and so the US won the battle. Israel is just a horse in US chest board. 

The propaganda has been that this is a war between Israel the evil colonizers and Palestinians the poor innocent victims.  It’s totally false. The situation is Syria was way worse a few years ago without over 500k Syrians being killed. They even used chemical weapons and crossed Obama red line but no one cared.  The reason everyone cares about this war which is minuscule compared to Syria and much less brutal is because of the propaganda that’s being fed on purpose by Iran to help keep their pawn (Hamas) in power. Unfortunately no one cares about Palestinian civilians they are being sacrificed by Iran for a bigger geopolitical war. It’s all about the $$$

17iq7ek,Message to other pro-Palestine people: The Hamas attack was despicable and wrong,"This is my opinion, from the perspective of an Arab of muslim culture, although not practicing, and with a leftist inclination, although not very political or committed to politics, Science is more my jam. It is only one opinion, a drop in an immense ocean of rhetoric, and probably sharing it does not matter, but I will share it anyway. Hopefully there are other Arabs who think the same:

I say this as someone who is pro-Palestinian cause and does not buy overall the Israeli propaganda, and who understands the persecution of the West Bank and Gaza, Gaza being akin to an open air prison in particular.  
But I can still walk and chew gum at the same time, I can be pro Gaza and still condemn the actions of Hamas, and I implore people here to do the same.  
What Hamas has done is wrong on so many levels, lets starts with arguments that do not appeal to humanity: This is a governing entity that is undemocratic (which is not a controversial statement) and quite reactionary, what gives it the right to launch an attack of such magnitude? that can only be taken as a declaration of war, without having the ability to protect people it is governing from retaliation. If I am responsible for my family I will not go out of my way to provoke a bear knowing I have no means to protect them. You want to resist, fine, make sure first you have equal strength to protect your people, anything else is suicidal, irresponsible and irrational.  
Ok, that's the cold strategic perspective, now for the humanitarian one:  
To go further, and not just launch a suicidal (to your people) attack , but also indiscriminately massacre civilians , men, women and children going about their daily lives, to massacre concert goers, that is immoral , despicable, monstrous and unforgivable. Any political entity that condones such an act does not deserve a place on the world stage.  
What hamas did was wrong, and we must condemn it unequivocally even more than the Jews. It is not ok when the IDF attacks civilians disproportionally and indiscriminately, hence it is also not ok when Hamas does it. Why would we condemn the IDF and not condemn Hamas.  
With everything going on in Gaza, I know some of you may will feel it is insensitive to make this statement now. I believe we must, for our souls, for our humanity.  
That is all I have to say.",28/10/23 23:37:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17iq7ek/message_to_other_propalestine_people_the_hamas/,131,152,417,Palestine,top,all
1aymrnm,The pro-Palestinian community's constant desire to undermine feminism,"Over the last few months, I have noticed a particular trend arise in the pro-Palestine movement: the constant desire to label everything as ""colonial feminism"" or ""white feminism"" if it is not about Palestine or does not relate to western imperialism in some form. 

For instance, as an Iranian, I have seen dozens upon dozens of articles calling out the support for Iranian women ""white feminism,"" or constantly saying, ""why did feminists stand up for Iran but not Palestine?"" This is an atrocious comparison for many reasons. Firstly, Iranians are fighting against gender apartheid and the systemic targeting of women, which is not at all directly relevant to the plight of Palestinians. Secondly, if you truly want to compare levels of support, Palestinians have received FAR more attention from Western people than Iranian women, from people wearing Keffiyehs to trying Palestinian dishes and hanging up Palestinian flags. When did we ever see such support for Iran over an extended period of time? Thirdly, it is much easier to speak about Iran than Palestine due to several political and contextual reasons, which have absolutely nothing to do with ""feminism,"" but rather, politics and society. Because in Iran, you can speak about Palestine as much as you want, but one word about the regime’s oppression & you’re in jail—is that feminism “acceptable” simply because you don’t see it as “imperialist”? And finally, why should there be a limit on how much support Iranians receive? Why do they constantly scrutinize support for my people, but then tell everyone they are not speaking about Palestine enough? Why do you need to bring up and diminish the plight of Iranians for your political arguments?

Given that such articles are often pushed out from Qatar-funded media (such as Middle East Eye) and people who never spoke in support of Iranians, I have good reason to believe that this undermining of feminism, especially as it pertains to Iran, is part of a global agenda fueled and perpetuated by the Islamic Republic. They are using this moment to dismiss the movement for Iran's liberation in many ways, and to also undermine the values they deem ""Western"": feminism and human rights. 

It frustrates me so much to witness this happening, and it infuriates me that many communities, especially Iranians, are so frequently trampled upon and spoken over in this movement that often prides itself on supporting ""collective liberation.""",24/02/24 05:32:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1aymrnm/the_propalestinian_communitys_constant_desire_to/,131,97,399,Palestine,top,all
18y7ytx,I live in Israel,"Israel really doesn't want this fight. We're all about living together in peace. But Hamas? They seem to want the opposite. It's not about Israel just bombing Gaza for no reason. It's about taking down Hamas, who hide behind their own people. It's a messy situation, with hospitals and schools being used by Hamas, putting everyone in danger.

For me, this hits home. My family and friends in Gaza are literally fighting for our right to live without fear. Every day, my wife is scared to even go out for a walk after dark. She had a close call with a kidnapping once. And it seems like almost all the serious crimes around here are done by Palestinians. It's beyond just violence; it's trying to spread fear, especially among women. What happened on October 7th was a nightmare – they killed a pregnet mother and wrapped her stomach open to stab the unborn baby in the chest, they raped a mother while she smelt the flesh of her child burnjng in front of her. The stormed Israel in the most horrific way. It's just unthinkable.

The way the media talks about Israel gets to me. Palestinian news makes it look one-sided, and they're pretty good at it. But we Israelis and Jews, we're not about playing those dirty games. We're just trying to live our lives here.

I guess if someone supports Hamas or even sides with Palestine, I should be mad at them, like they're against me personally. But I don't hate anyone. I'm not angry. I'm just really sad about how people are so misinformed about what's happening here. My biggest fear? All this hate towards Israel and Jews turning into something as awful as another Holocaust.

I just wish everyone would see the whole picture, you know? Stand with us, stand for what's right. Stand for humanity, stand for Israel, and let's hope for a future where we can all live in peace, without this fear and hate.

And I'll finish with this. If you actually care for the people in Gaza for the kids and innocent families you must not be pro hamas because hamas doesn't give a shit about them, hamas uses them and manipulates them. If Israel had control and they gave up violence they will live a great life with just as much freedom as me or any jew in Israel.

I always reply with ""then, what do you suggest Israel to do in order to deal with Hamas? It's either Hamas surrenders and hand out the hostages, or Israel will have to deal with Hamas - which will create many more Palestinian casualties since they use them as human shields."" 

At this point I never get a reply back, never.

Thank you for the discussion, let's hope we can continue discussing with each other for a better future.

I will also mention that out of all the replies there was only one good suggestion that I'd like to share (I can't find it to credit the dude/dudette) 
They suggested the creation of a safe zone outside of Gaza which every citizen who will enter that will be checked for weapons and identity. This will reduce the amount of civilian casualties and make the operation run smoother. The major issus is where it will be, and how. It needs the help and coordination of the UN and possibly Egypt as well to work.

I am angry at the Brittish's designation of what ended up being a split up palestine and a newly formed israel uprooting palestinians. I understand jews have technically been calling this region thier homeland, but the nation was formed upon an already living nation. There is basically nowhere for jews to go after hundreds of years of persecution.

I don't want to see jews compeltely eradicated. The amount of anti semitism and islamaphobia around the world is crazy right now. I know the israeli government is incredibly war-focused, there needs to be an intervention in the governing. But what is there to do? If i say free palestine i feel like I'm telling my jewish side that it's ok to be eradicated. If i say anything pro Israel i feel like i will be called pro genocide. I am at a loss on any neutral information on this conflict. Please help me understand my place. Are there any resolutions to the conflict that lets palestine and israel live freely? What does the end look like on either side? I hope this post is ok and understanding. I am just confused on what i can do to help anyone.

1bbe5pv,What to say to someone who is utterly convinced Israel orchestrated October 7th?,"One of my friends and I have hit a bit of a snag in our friendship. While I respect he is STAUNCHLY pro-Palestinian, I cannot ignore the fact he keeps stating that Israel orchestrated the October 7th attacks. Nothing I say can convince him otherwise. He is absolutely convinced Israel made this attack happen in order to justify genocide. I ask him what his source is for this, and he just says, ""I just know it"". I say, ""yes, but you need a source if you're going to make such claims"". But he just claims that he ""knows it"" and ""can feel it"" and ""knows it to be true"".

I feel he doesn't even think for himself. He is just sucking in all the Western pro-Palestinian media and conspiracy theories and regurgitating them. I can't even have a rational talk with him about this. He starts by saying stuff like, ""Israel had a right to defend itself, but they've gone too far"". Fair enough. But then... ""And therefore I KNOW Israel set this whole thing up"".

I have suspected for a while he might be antisemitic, so when he does this ""I just know"" business, I do have to wonder if what he REALLY means is ""Because that's what Jews do"" or something antisemitic like that.

I personally am pro-neither. I think both sides have done bad things. But I just feel this is the latest trend of trying to ignore or deny that Hamas/Palestine have done wrong, too. And my friend just will not see it any other way. I don't know what to do, or whether to stay friends with him. He is really showing his true colors here. He is just ignoring and outright denying a horrific massacre. This feels just one step away from Holocaust denial to be honest.

I have a few Israeli friends and they’ve never been racist towards me or treated me badly so I find it funny when people say they are white supremacists (I’m black) but on the other hand alot of pro-Palestinians will call me slurs when I tell them to not be racist? Ive even donated to Gaza charities for palestine. Yet just because I don’t support Hamas I’m suddenly a zionist and ‘pro-Israel’ to my friends and other people?

I feel like all these people are just performative activists like they try and say Hamas is not terrorist group when there are literal body cam videos of innocent Israeli’s getting shot down even dogs are being killed? There are testimonies of Israeli’s who were held captive saying they saw other women and men get raped? And yet I see my ‘friends’ reposting these stuff and making fun of women who were raped and killed by Hamas? Then when I call them out for that they accuse me of being a zionist lol!

Like right now Im at the centre and i don’t know which side to support since Ive been subjected to discrimination. Why cant we just acknowledge that both sides have innocent civilians being killed? Some of my Israeli friends have family members who were killed and my other ‘friends’ are telling me I cant sympathise with them because they “deserve it” what??? No one deserves to be killed is this not antisemitism? Saying that innocent jewish people deserve to die… and then they blocked me.",06/12/23 23:50:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18chyoq/my_propalestine_irl_friends_unfollowed_me_and_im/,127,211,356,Palestine,top,all
w2zvan,Is it hateful to say that certain groups (like women) have more rights in Israel than in Palestine?,"I was in one of those threads on Israel/Palestine in a popular subreddit and things naturally get heated (the post itself was removes, after getting 60k upvotes...). Anyway, the next day I got banned for this comment :

>If you are a woman, LGBTQIA, atheist, apostate or whatever - you'd probably be treated better in Israel than Palestine.

I reached out to the mods,asking why. He responded that I'm an Islamophobic bigot. I then responded to him with [links](https://www.one-tab.com/page/UJiYdC-lTo-ro85OffnPuQ) to articles and reports, detailing problems in Palestine faced by those groups I mentioned. (These were not links to fringe right wing websites, but to normal sites - NYT, the UN, Freedom House, Amnesty and others.) I asked him if it's bigotry to say ""different countries have different human rights standards"" - such as Israel and Palestine. He didn't like that, and doubled down on the bigotry attack:

>The problem for you is that I know what you are doing. You are  intellectualizing your hate for Muslims by trying to be ""academic"" about  it.  
>  
>You are a bigot my friend. You have a problem with Muslims and I want you to know that I see it clear as day.

In my opinion, he wasn't operating in good faith. He has his worldview, and anyone criticizing  a minority/non-white country must be a bigot/racist/Islamophobic.

What are your thoughts? Can the criticism be made?

16gbn2z,Why I left the Pro-Palestine movement,"The following describes my experiences as a young Jewish woman entering, and then leaving, the pro-Palestinian movement. I have, for obvious reasons, tried to leave out identifying details. Thank you to everyone who gave me the nudge to tell this story.

TLDR: The ‘pro-Palestine' movement lied to me and preyed upon personal vulnerabilities so I would act as a fig leaf for their antisemitism. I eventually discovered how callous they were with Jewish lives and the extent to which their real motivations did not align with anything that benefits the Palestinian people. I now believe that similarly uninformed ‘international input’ may be a driver in the conflict.

_Entering Activism._ I made the worst decision of my life when I took the advice of some people who told me that a degree from an American university was best, and enrolled in an American university as a college freshman. I had lived in America before, so I thought I would be able to handle myself and I felt rather ‘worldly’ at 18 — which really just meant that I didn’t know how to say, ‘I don't know.’ It seemed impossible to me, given my ethnic/national background, that I would know so little about the conflict… but at that time, I could barely distinguish the West Bank from Gaza. At first, I tried to steer clear of the topic, but this ended when I became extremely invested in a major ‘hot button issue’ in the US at that time — a particular pipeline running through historically Native American land. This is how I met a group of people who would change my life for the worse: a loose-knit collective of leftist activists who taught me the difference between leftism (the good one) and liberalism (very bad!) — between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation — between bisexual and pansexual (oh boy). Suddenly, I was a social justice warrior not from behind a keyboard, but in person — first we carpooled to protests, and then at some point, we were the ones organising the protests. 

_’How big of an activist were you really?’_ Not very big, lol! We were little fish in a big pond. My crowning achievement of the activist phase was when I met a big-name politician at one of my protests. I never appeared on tv or did interviews (although I eventually did manage to spark some far-right backlash and a tiny online doxxing effort). It ended there, thankfully. 

_’So how’d you get into this issue?’_ As I ‘unlearned my internalised prejudice’ and ‘activized,’ I kept getting drawn closer to the topic of I/P, which as I’ve mentioned, I had about an ankle-depth knowledge of. I remember one of the first big conversations we had about it, where they went on a vitriolic rant about all the ways Israel was bad, and then they stopped, and let the silence hang — this was my time to either cement my ‘membership’ or get kicked out. I uncomfortably said some version of ‘yeah, fuck Israel!’ They made it sound like an open and shut case, and what would I do about it? Just stand aside? No chance! I had to let Israel know that I _as a Jew_ didn’t want them to do these things! _As a Jew,_ I had to do something about the atrocities being committed ‘in my name!’ (I specifically remember using that phrase, which honestly makes me cringe to even type)

_My exact political positions._ I actually wouldn’t have been able to remember in great detail since there is a lot of water under the bridge, except that while doing some lazy googling I recently stumbled upon an old Quora thread asking ‘who is right, Israel or Palestine?’ And one of the top answers was an Israeli saying, ‘as an Israeli, I’m telling you that you should support Palestine, because they need your support more.’ And that brought back to me the entire old chain of logic. That’s how I thought. I sincerely believed that Israel was under no threat — but the Palestinians were. (Note the deceptive phrasing, which was common at the time: Israel was a monolith, whereas Palestinians were many individual human beings) I believed that it was our duty to impress upon the stronger actor the necessity of doing better in all respects, and support the Palestinians in their struggles as the downtrodden and disfavoured (_it’s not fair that one kind of person has better quality of life than another, just based on where they were born!_ thought I). I believed that Israel had the power to end the conflict and create lasting peace. I believed that the Palestinian demands were reasonable (yet somehow, we never spent any time actually discussing the deals which have been on the table) but at the same time I believed that the harm which had been done to them was probably too vast to ever fully be repaired. Perhaps most embarrassingly, I believed that if enough people said ‘No Israel! Stop doing the bad things!’ Israel would realise that there was a better way, and would stop doing the bad things, and then the world would be a better place.

_Why I started to doubt._ It was getting to the point where, having turned out for all kinds of actions on all kinds of other issues, at some point soon I was going to either have to go and hold up a Palestinian flag on a college campus, or make a huge life change — and I already had doubts brewing. I’d been avoiding a direct, physical presentation of this sentiment because I had eventually done some research, and things didn’t add up. There was so much that they left out of the narrative, so many inconsistencies, and maybe in the back of my mind there was even something assimilated from my background that made me think… this doesn’t feel right. 

_The breaking point._ But then there was a major shooting at a synagogue in the US and someone I know was personally affected. This was a crucial moment in my life. I truly believed that I would become the recipient of the support which we had been giving to every other marginalised, disaffected group when something bad happened to them — but the silence was deafening. I asked what we were doing about this and they said how awful it was but… nothing. No action was planned. No major show of solidarity with the Jewish community. Quietly, questions of — were the congregations Zionist? trickled around, just out of earshot (but one other person later confirmed my suspicions that the question was asked.) There was a sense of dissatisfaction, like the attack was an inconvenient distraction from ‘the main story’ — and I saw for the first time that I had fallen for a scam. Treat my time and energy like money — now think of the _’first they come for x, then they come for-‘_ thing — now imagine this was like me investing in the human rights pension fund. I keep putting money in for the collective defense of human rights, and eventually I’m the one whose rights need defending, and all the people I’ve stood up for will now stand up for me.

Right? Wrong. Not if you are Jewish.

_My current political positions._ I am staunchly pro-Israel. I believe in taking small, unsexy, bureaucratic steps to lessen the friction between the two parties so we can cohabitate in this area with less violence. Things like: they get rid of the martyr’s fund and we make some significant changes in our permit-issuing systems to speed along their economic development. I also strongly believe that the world needs to stop pandering to or even passively accepting any viewpoints which imply genocide: ‘from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’ should earn jail time in Western countries. We must also have international funding reforms: the states who contribute to the PA/UNRWA/etc. must use their leverage to force anticorruption measures. Speaking of UNRWA, it must be abolished immediately and all Palestinian refugees must be resettled under the mandate of the UNHCR. We cannot continue to play to the fantasy that Israel will vanish: we must address the plight of the Palestinians in a sustainable way which inches towards stable, limited autonomy (without falling on our own sword in terms of security, and expecting the international community to stop the bleeding, as ‘antizionist jews’ do). But perhaps the most important thing I can contribute is to say that a viewpoint which would centre Palestinian lives requires separating the Palestinian political leadership’s goals from the wellbeing of the Palestinian people. Who is served by keeping them in the camps without resettlement? The political leaders, for whom they are a bargaining chip. Who is served by intifadas? The Palestinian leadership, for without the chaos which places Israel as the convenient scapegoat, their incompetent governance would be plain for the world to see and they could not continue to redirect domestic discontent. Why would the Palestinian leadership even want to improve the conditions of the people when the international aid rolls in only on the basis of well-publicised deplorable conditions? We are all falling for it: the propagandised Palestinian population, the international community which pays to keep the status quo grinding along painfully, and of course you, my pro-palestinian reader who believes that you’re going to create positive change in the world by commenting ‘free Palestine’ on any post featuring an Israeli or, dare I say it, sometimes just a Jew.

I am an imperfect messenger but my message is my truth, so I challenge you to skip any critiques of my writing style or word choice and address the substance of what I have said.

Edit to add a point of clarification:

_To what extent was I victimized?_ I’m seeing some debate about this — were they coercive? Did I have agency?

On an individual level, no, I did not ever fear for my physical safety, although I’m guessing that if I had stated a strongly Zionist stance at that time it would have resulted in some degree of harassment and severe social ostracisation. I absolutely had agency: I could have stayed away from all of this and wiser 18 year old Jews did. I made a mistake, and I own that — this is a part of me trying to make it right. When I say I was preyed upon, I mean that they took advantage of specific weaknesses related to me and my background which made me an ideal target for this. My sexuality, my family dynamics, and a lot of things which I didn’t reveal in this post all played a crucial role in how I ended up in this group. But what I wanted to focus on here is that they used my desire to do good in the world to make me complicit in something that I now find abhorrent, and I believe they exploited characteristics of 18-year-old me which a lot of other people that age have in common — and if you’re not on some level sensitized to antisemitism (ie, by being Jewish) then you might never get the wake-up call that I did. What I want people to take away from this is a better understanding of how this ideology is spread on college campuses, not whether I personally am an idiot or a victim.

ikkivt,Palestinians should accept Israel,"
Ok so this is a very controversial topic as a Muslim but I strongly believe Palestine should accept Israel as legitimate state. I mean both the countries have been fighting with each other for too long and innocent people have lost their life on both sides. Palestine joining Israel will solve most of the problems ( I think). I don’t think with the current geo-politics , Palestine can ever beat Israel. Also Israel is a democratic country with top notch facilities like healthcare , top ranking universities and better facilities overall. If Palestine comes under Israel and they offer Palestinians some level of autonomy and make some quotas( reservations) in the government. I think it’ll be win-win for both of them. Also both the communities (Muslims and Jews) must realise how extremely similar their culture and religion is. They literally worship the same God. 
Also I think what UAE did this month was a dick move and I in no way deny the legitimacy of Palestine and how they are persecuted but I believe the only solution is to join them. Like the saying If you can’t defeat them join them. I mean come on it’s 21st century we shouldn’t fight for these things. I also believe the world is not doing enough as to solve the matter. All this bureaucracy and the lack of interest to solve the problem is going on for too long. Also both countries should stop their war crimes and respect the sanctity of the place. Considering how holy the land is for Muslims , Christians and Jews. 

Plz keep in mind I am young guy with limited knowledge of the world. I might be wrong but at the end all I want is peace between the two communities.

ne8665,UPD: My feelings as a Palestinian living in Israel,"Original thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nc0y47/my_feelings_as_a_palestinian_living_in_israel/

Three days passed since I posted. When I was writing the post the storm was at its strongest.  
My post was not meant to be taken as a matter of fact or objective truth.  It's meant to be read as one individual's unique experience of the conflict.  
People here need to realize that the people's feelings and thoughts are being manipulated by the society they grew in, their media, politicians, governments, giant corporations, foreign governments, giant institutions, religions and ideologies.

Arabs and Jews have thousands of years of bullshit being accumulated into their brains. Like I was at a giant protest in 2020 and people were still talking to me about Abraham and how Ishmael was Arab and Itzhak was a Jew and why based on the scripture Arabs are shitty or Jews are shitty.   

To proceed towards a better future we must all first recognize the fact that we are all humans. Our refusal to accept this and put it as our core principle before any other religion, ideology or what not is causing millions of people enormous amount of suffering. The common people lives are being toyed with with no regards at all to the consequences it has on their experience in this one life we all get  one shot at.  
If you're reading this as a person who holds animosity towards Arabs or Jews I want you to re-examine everything about how you view the other side of the conflict before you bring another child to the world and condemn him to a shitty reality.

I want to end this with a powerful statement that helped me get through this past very dark couple of days.

""Look at the people helping, there are always people helping. We need to have faith in each others as humans first and foremost if we want to lessen the horrible suffering everywhere around us.""",17/05/21 05:57:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/ne8665/upd_my_feelings_as_a_palestinian_living_in_israel/,126,151,316,Palestine,top,all
1bpxhpk,MENA Pro-Palestinians Justify Their Own Countries' Ethnic Cleansings,"Recent interactions on Reddit and in real life has called me to ask this question.    


Since the end of the 1948 war, 90% of the Jewish populations in Muslim majority countries fled, leaving their assets and property behind.  Before you claim that this is colonialism to create the Jewish state, I want to reiterate that almost all of the migrations occurred after the state of Israel was created.  


Here is a breakdown of the pre-1948 and current populations:  


Morocco: 265,000 / 2,000  
Algeria: 140,000 / <50  
Tunisia: 105,000 / 1,700  
Libya: 38,000 / 0  
Egypt: 75,000 / <20  
Lebanon: 24,000 / <100  
Syria: 30,000 / <100  
Iran: 100,000 / 10,000  
Yemen: 63,000 / <50  


If you are a pro-palestinian, do you feel your country has a responsibility for what is currently going on between Israel and Palestine?  Would those Jews be offered the same ""Right of Return"" that is demanded for the Palestinians?

How can you claim Israel is committing a genocide, or an ethnic cleansing, when MENA absolutely wiped their Jewish populations off the map.  


This is a great example of why Pro-Israel supporters call out the double standards set against Israel compared to the rest of the world.  Genocides don't matter, unless they can blame Israel for it.  Ethnic cleansings don't matter, unless they can accuse Israel of doing it.  Apartheid states and second-class citizens don't matter, unless they can accuse Israel of committing it.  


All of the while, if you believe that Israel existing is an inherent problem, your countries only strengthened Israels argument that not only that they should exist, but that they are justified in whatever they must do in ensuring that their existence continues.  


The ""White Colonialism"" narrative is such an egregious lie.  The claim that supporters aren't antisemitic, only anti-zionist does not seem to hold water when it is applied to the actions of the nations and people who state these claims.  


For the non-MENA Pro-Palestinian supporters.  I will assume in good-faith that you were unaware of these facts, and if you were, I would ask what your solution/justification would be.  How do you hold Israel to the same standards that no other country in the region has ever had to follow, and continues not to follow.

hm3cjv,You don't need to pick sides,"The entire rhetoric of ""whose side are you on"" is, in itself, counterproductive towards a solution. Both sides make a lot of claims and have made a lot of actions. Some of them are morally justified, and some are not. Some have merit, and some do not. By taking a side, you are necessarily disregarding aspects of the conflict which can not be ignored if we ever want to navigate ourselves out of this mess. The question should never be ""who is right"" but ""how do we move past this"". The only purpose of this play-of-favorites rhetoric is to perpetuate the conflict by polarizing the dialogue around it. And it breaks my heart that even in this sub, where people are sincerely trying to find the ways to overcome this tragedy, this kind of dialogue is essentially the baseline.

In my opinion, if we want to make even the slightest change, we have to be critical and compassionate towards both sides. And (I can't stress this enough), when confronted with someone which isn't compassionate towards one side, try to overcome this by building empathy. Don't try to explain why the other side is as bad as yours, but rather, try to explain why this conflict is actually very difficult for you too. If someone tries to vilify Israel, respond by humanizing Israel, not by vilifying Palestine. And the other way around.

It is hard to be positive after generations of strain, it is hard to be compassionate when you were born into a bloody conflict. Each of us have lost friends to this ongoing nightmare. But it is our obligation to try. We will never reach a full and complete understanding over everything, but I believe there is much more that we could agree on, and once we build mutual trust, we will find the way to compromise on the rest in a mutually respectful way. But this will only happen if we work hard to bring our commonalities to light, and this could just not happen if we are too busy defending ""our side"", whatever it may be.",06/07/20 07:46:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/hm3cjv/you_dont_need_to_pick_sides/,123,267,349,Palestine,top,all
17xhcam,Opinion of a Lebanese,"""Don’t fall for Hamas propaganda. As a Lebanese man who lived in Jordan, has Palestinian family members, and  has spent time in Palestine, I can tell you that when I first went there in the nineties, there were no walls. Palestinians were not confined and they had more freedom in Israel than in any other the Arab countries in which there are so-called Palestinian refugee camps. When the Oslo Accords were agreed to and a two state solution was part of that, some Palestinian leaders kicked off the Intifada and began attacking Israeli civilians. This led to the rift in Palestinian leadership that divided Palestine into territories controlled by the PA and their rival, Hamas with its founding charter calling for the death of Jews and the destruction of Israel. For nearly twenty years now Hamas has been launching attacks against Israel. This hasn’t done anything positive for the Palestinian people living under the brutal rule of Hamas. Attacks on Israeli civilians led to the building of walls and increased security, making it difficult for anyone to move between Palestinian Territories and between Palestinian Territories and Israel. Israelis, and especially Orthodox Jews have coexisted with Christian and Muslim communities for millennia. It is the Muslim Brotherhood inspired extremism that drives Hamas, which has routinely used its own civilian population as human shields  and has the blood of thousands of Palestinians on its hands since its founding. It often provokes retaliation on civilian targets to use in its propaganda campaigns. That is exactly what we are witnessing since their cowardly attacks on October 7. Shockingly, supposedly educated people around the world have been seduced by Hamas in the wake of their evil atrocities. Ironically, the Gays for Palestine movement is now promoting a group of extreme religious terrorists who would gleefully throw them off of rooftops.""

17z8v6a,My sister’s response to a friend who asked if Israel’s response was proportional.,"
I loved her response and I wanted to share it.  If you agree with what she wrote please pass it on. Thanks❤️

I agree with you in that there should be investigations during and after any war and there needs to be consequences if there are war crimes. I also agree with you that innocent civilians should never be hurt and I grieve for those caught in this horrendous war.

Here is where we may diverge, my view of Palestinian deaths include Hamas accountability and they will not stop. 
My issue is in regards to the incredibly biased narrative.

IDF has put out far more than 4 million texts, phone calls, brochures for evacuation. We also know that Hamas blocked the routes out of Northern Gaza and even shot and killed Palestinians trying to go south. That is a fact. We now see loads of videos where we see evidence of Hamas embedding themselves in schools and hospitals. Such as Al Shifa, which has been known by the UN since 2014 as being used by Hamas’s headquarters as they used it when they were fighting Fatah but you have to search for that info. 

We also know that Hamas has sent thousands of rockets into Israel And hit an Israeli hospital, not discussed. We also know that 30% of its rockets don’t get to where they’re supposed to go and fall back on Palestinian infrastructure, not discussed. We also know it takes fuel to run those rockets, never mentioned. We also know that Hamas has distorted and outright lied consistently and they are the only origin of information, so I am reserving my judgement on swallowing whole their facts and figures. 

We also know, that the men who ran this massacre, lacked so much humanity that they not only raped women but also dismembered them, go pro’d it, shared it on FB and danced with glee celebrating. Many killed were not even Jewish. 
These are the people who have ruled Palestine for 20 years. Imagine the propaganda embedded in the society. We also know that in 2016 300 million a year was being paid to families of Palestinians who committed terrorist act. These are lifetime payments and seen as incentives to terror. It still goes on today. We know that Hamas Leaders have billions in their bank accounts, many safely residing in Qatar. Treaties for peace would mean giving up a lot of money. We also know that they planned this massacre for about two years and although they could build 300 miles of tunnel that they do not open up to Palestinian civilians for cover (no one considers that), they never thought once to create bomb shelters or a plan for Palestinian safety. We also know that much humanitarian aid that was supposed to go to Palestinians went to Hamas (that has been proven).
In 2005, 9000 settlers were removed from Gaza and Jewish bodies were dug up from the ground and removed from Gaza for peace. For one year, it looks like there was going to be peace. No air and water sanctions at the time. Then came Hamas, and thousands of rockets came flying into Israel along with many suicide bombers. This was before the wall or iron dome. 
The Hamas charter is to annihilate all Jews. I want you to give me one example where Hamas has agreed to peace or even indicated that they wanted it. Remember there was a cease fire before 7th October. 
And I will ask you, when on party doesn’t want peace, how will you obtain it? give me a solution? Mine would be to put pressure on Iran and Qatar to stop funding them because if they are cut off financially that might work but I don’t think that will happen because they don’t want Israel to have an alliance with Saudi Arabia nor do they want them to be competitive in the oil market. That is the real reason for the massacre.",19/11/23 22:26:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17z8v6a/my_sisters_response_to_a_friend_who_asked_if/,122,345,663,Palestine,top,all
nahucf,On the edge of a civil war because of politicians,"This is not the first war with Gaza, but this time it's different.

In previous wars, it was usually between Israel and Gaza with some support that Gaza and Hamas got from within Israel.

But this time, it's reversed, it started as a conflict between the Palestinians inside of Israel and the government, from there came the confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians, and then came the confrontation with Gaza, which in turn increase the confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians. 

And now, it seems like we are headed into civil war, and you can't stop and wonder, why? and is it actually justified? and the answer is no.

How we got here? bad politicians, on both sides, that gain benefit from dividing us, because then they sell themselves as the only one who can stop it, and also because it deflects fire from their failure and corruption. 

We got here because Bibi lost, he saw that in a matter of weeks he will lose his position as prime minister, so in the time he still had he did everything he could to escalate things. Banned the sitting in Damascus gate during Ramadan, approved the eviction in Sheik Jarah, and overall did nothing to keep the flames down.

And from the Palestine side, over their election, that they postponed each tried to score more credit, and also they both tried to deflect their poor handling of Corona and overall the economic failure that they created.

So we go to war, for their political benefit, but this time they escalate it so much that it broke the ""Hamas vs IDF"" status, and it became a civil war, people are attacking their neighbors, people they know, civilians go out to the street to confront with other civilians. This becomes a religious war / civil war.

And for what really? what started it? literally nothing, nothing that they can't solve in 5 minutes without war.

And now we go to war because our politicians manage to divide us, for their political interest. 

We have to break this pattern where dividing us = political strength for them. Then, and only then they will work to resolve the issues instead of increasing them.

Intentionally putting people lives at risk, for no cause, should be stopped. 

And it really feels like nothing can be done because too many people eat it up, and I am not sure if I am part of a silent majority or a very small minority.",12/05/21 06:06:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nahucf/on_the_edge_of_a_civil_war_because_of_politicians/,125,68,412,Palestine,top,all
178b9nk,Don't change your opinion on the conflict for people without a plan.,"I've seen a lot of people here speak with emotions which are fairly delusional. I've seen lots of social media posts which are just raw emotions. 

If your plan is just ""Free Palestine"", it's not a plan. The attack by Hamas clearly didn't improve the lives of the Gazans. Hamas is a violent and terroristic organization, if you just support it then you're supporting them repeatedly attacking the Israelis till they lash out. That's not a plan, that's encouraging suicide of the Gazan people. Even if you think Israel is evil, it's still not a plan.

Killing all the Muslims isn't a plan, and the IDF aren't following that. I haven't seen too many super racist Israelis. They have a plan to kill all of Hamas, the terroristic group that organized an attack, and they are carrying it out because they feel forced into it. If you feel they should stop, you need to produce a plan that will realistically stop the rocket attacks and violence.

The whole region has been hurt by delusional people without a plan who pushed their ideals with no thought of the future. Outsiders were fine with donations being used to arm Hamas and wage war, because they supported the struggle. The struggle isn't doing anything good for Gaza now, and the lack of infrastructure is killing them. People repeatedly push Israel to stop fighting, and the end result has been more violence by Hamas, which isn't a plan with any future.

Seek out people with a realistic plan to end the violence and improve society, not people who show you instagram pictures and catchy headlines and push a catchphrase. If a friend pushes ideas on you, ask them what their plan is to fix Gazan's infrastructure woes and rocket attacks on Israel and the Israeli settlements.

1ailrza,So... The Palestinian identity didn't start until the PLO? And the Israelites never existed?,"Throw away the account. I am a Palestinian living in USA. My entire extended family fled in '48 and bounced between different Arab countries before finally immigrating to the USA after the Gulf War. I was born in the 90s, never stepped foot in Palestine so I'd be lying if I said I have a strong attachment to the land like many millenials my age here claim they do. Because of this I'm able to look at things with more of an open mind.

Something I hear often as an anti-Palestinian indigenous argument is that the Palestinian identity is fake.

From what I understand, the term Palestine was used by the Byzantine and a few other empires (pre-Islam). The name never stuck because Islam came in the 600s along with Arabization, and Arab society before the formation of borders was tribal and identified with their community rather than a collective national identity.

During Ottoman rule, the Ottomans referred to Palestine as southern Syria. When the British came along and split the Arab borders post-World War I, they decided on Palestine, using one of the many historic names of the area. The Arabs, of course, didn't refer to themselves as Palestinians, as they didn't want to refer to themselves by the name colonizers gave their borders.

From 1948 to 1967, the Arabs of the land in the West Bank were taken by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. This move was not intended to create an independent state but to assert Jordanian sovereignty over the territory.

In 1964, the PLO was formed and adopted the name Britain gave the territory. After losing the 1967 war and the West Bank becoming occupied by Israel, the Arab struggle grew as a people without a country and started identifying with the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat as their representative.

They say this is the start of the Palestinian identity. So I have a few questions. And don't think I'm a defensive person; I'm just looking for answers. Also, do let me know if I got anything wrong with the timeline above.


**Question for Israelis:** If this is true, how did the Palestinian identity stick so well after 1967? How did even my grandmother, who lives in Kuwait, start identifying as Palestinian, my uncles in UK and USA, along with all displaced Palestinians globally? This would be an extremely difficult lie: every Palestinian globally agreeing on an identity, sticking to it, having strong nationalism, and convincing themselves of the long history of the ""Palestinian"" people. If you could please explain to me how this is possible?



**Question for Palestinians:** Why do many Palestinians believe there was no such thing as a historic Jewish kingdom or civilization in the land; it was always Palestine, despite this contradicting our religion and the factual historic timeline of Abrahamic religions before Prophet Muhammad SAW? This is something I hear a lot from family members. I was also shocked to hear that this thinking is shared by many Palestinians. Like, are we denying the existence of Dawud (David) and Sulayman (Soloman), or were they Palestinian according to us?

17vevwq,People's responses to October 7th demonstrate a HUGE dehumanization problem,"On the morning of October 7th, I woke up to my Twitter timeline filled with gruesome videos and images of the October 7th massacre. I immediately was sickened. The first video I saw that morning when opening my Twitter was the girl in sweatpants, being taken out of a trunk of a car, and put in the backseat. She was bleeding from her backside.

I found the video incredibly triggering. What was even worse was the comments underneath - people saying ""how do we know she was raped?"" to ""she was a soldier, she knew what she got into"", and even ""she probably was sitting in blood, she's a soldier"". I'm someone who has historically been pretty pro-Palestine, but this was so demeaning, I just couldn't make sense of it. I also saw the video of them parading around that girl's body, and people even commenting on that, ""she was probably a soldier"". 

Worse were people saying, ""this is what revolution looks like"" - and the celebrations and protests that happened *hours* after news of October 7th came out. The crisis was still ongoing, and people were being so callous.

***There's no justification for any of this.***

The biggest point of hypocrisy was that these were people who championed the #metoo movement, who called everyone a Nazi for the most minor reasons, who were so sensitive to victims of violent crime. But in this instance, it felt like no one held those values anymore.

I made a video on this, talking about the insane responses on October 7th, as well as some of the far-left's largest content creators repeating these things. I think it's pretty damning. If you were upset by some of the stuff being said, maybe you like this video:

1b1xmh8,"The Palestinian cause, martyrdom, and Aaron Bushnell (self-immolation protester)","Aaron Bushnell, an American Air Force veteran, self-immolated himself screaming “free Palestine” before he screamed in agony and melted. 

Islamists and Palestinian groups called him a martyr for the cause. Leftist groups called him honorable. Moderates and conservatives called him mentally ill. 

His Reddit account that was shared this morning indicates he was a leftist and an anarchist. Not American virtues, unless you are an American that wants to topple the American government. 

A few points:

Self immolation, religious or not, is a disturbing act. I don’t think society should encourage people to take their own lives as an act of protest. Because by extension suicidal behavior can also encourage homicidal behavior. So this should be a concern even to people who agree with voluntary euthanasia.

The biggest issue with the pro-Palestinian movement is that it utterly ignores how identical Palestinian warfare is to very dangerous Islamic  terrorist organizations. The type that severely threatens western civilization. Al qaeda, Isis, and other Muslim brotherhood types of organizations. Hamas is identical to these groups, but pro-Palestine people in the west feel the need to provide cover to Hamas out of sympathy of Palestinian civilians. It also ignores the level of support Palestinians have for their Islamic terrorist government.

This is a major problem. The natural consequence of Hamas being successful is the creation of a Sunni Islamist state. The resistance in Ireland, South Africa and other countries had democratic goals. The Palestinian people do not. 

As such, Americans are witnessing an interpretation of Bushnell’s suicide that is not different than what Jews experience from anti Zionists and Palestinians. 

Why? Because Bushnell wore an American uniform, is being interpreted as America support for the Palestinian people. I don’t believe that Bushnell had American values. I think he exploited his history of being in the American military to perpetuate an anti American message. And naturally Islamists are arguing that he represents America. That America supports Martyrdom.It’s another example of a radical leftist being used for an Islamist purpose. 

Jews mostly feel that accusing israel of being genocidal is not only a lie, but also hypocritical and offensive, considering that the enemy Israel faces has genocidal goals towards the Jews. This is where the anti semitism charge comes from. So in response, pro Palestinian people find woke Jews who support their cause to argue that anti Zionism has nothing to do with anti semitism. They’ll parade a Jewish voice for peace activist, or the Naturei Karta to make that argument. Then they scream at Zionist Jews (most Jews by a long shot) that there are many Jews that support the Palestinians. The average Jewish anti Zionist uses their heritage or even history of Jewish upbringing to perpetuate an anti-Jewish message (ie “as a Jew, here’s how I feel…) we saw this in Nazi Germany, the Association of German National Jews. This isn’t unique to Jews either. We’ve all heard of “Uncle Tom”. Every demographic has outliers that go against the desires of the group. 

And that’s what they’re doing with Bushnell. “See? This American died for Palestine! SO many Americans support the Palestinians”. The guy was a leftist anarchist. He does not represent the views of the majority of Americans. 

There is no substance to the Palestinian movement. It’s all about “destroying the occupiers”. They don’t talk about what “freedom” means to them. Why? Because they know that it’s not the same as what a westerner wants when they call for freedom. It’s sharia law. 

Leftists, pro Palestinian activists, and Palestinian people should be grilled on what type of government they want. Their ideologies. That’s part of the debate and integral to the conversation. If they’re not forced to reconcile the fact that this conflict exists largely because of their ideology, it does two very bad things:

1) Naive western people incorrectly assume that the Palestinian cause is ideologically in line with westernism and cover as well as in some cases shower praise on Islamic terrorist organizations. 

2) the Palestinian people aren’t encouraged to look in the mirror and understand why their ideology is harming their people.

qyvjff,Settler = Jew,"As some of you have heard, there was a shooting attack today in Jerusalem which resulted in the death of an Israeli civilian. Palestinian media is framing it as a heroic act of resistance against settlers in ""occupied Jerusalem"".

[Quds News Network](https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1462354674292568065?s=20)

[Eye On Palestine](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWiIlLON5QD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

The civilian who was killed lived in Modi'in which is not in the West Bank/over the Green Line and the attack happened in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem.

In order to make the claim that he is a settler true a few things need to apply:

1. If you are anywhere in the country even if you don't live there you are a settler if line 5 applies.
2. If you live anywhere even if it isn't in the West Bank/over the Green Line you are a settler if line 5 applies.
3. If you are a civilian you are a settler if line 5 applies.
4. If you are minding your own business you are a settler if line 5 applies.
5. If you are Jewish (not Israeli because an Israeli Arab wouldn't have been shot and Palestinians don't consider them to be Israeli anyways) you are a settler.

From this we can learn that settler is just another word for Jew. It doesn't matter where you are, what you are doing, where you live, the only defining factor which allows you to be ""justifiably"" killed according to Palestinians is that you are a Jew. Let's stop pretending that settler means anything else.

1ax2cl9,Hitler vs Netanyahu,"One of the trends I see on social media is something along the lines of ""The genocide in Gaza is worse than the Holocaust"". One such post I recently saw on Instagram ([link here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3hS77lOHBD/?igsh=eTRpYWd4eW1saWRq)) supported this and it was basically depicting Netanyahu as a far more evil individual than Hitler due to the number of children murdered by their armies. The information was conveniently drafted in a way to force misinterpretation. The post showed the two individuals (Hitler and Netanyahu side by side each having a number on top of their head in a very big and prominent font (127 and 178 for Hitler and Netanyahu respectively). On top of those numbers in very small text were the words ""Number of children killed per day in Auschwitz Camp"" vs ""Number of children killed per day in Gaza"". From the first look at this post, I called BS. I'd like to play with numbers now for this next part. Feel free to correct these numbers if I'm wrong. note: I'm pulling them from multiple sources.

Let's leave Netanyahu aside for a second, we'll come back to that so don't worry...

Hitler killed about 232,000 children at the Auschwitz Camp. This camp operated for a period of 5 years (May 1940 to January 1945). With some simple math we can get the daily average of 127 children murdered per day (232000/(5x365)). Although this verifies the number on top of Hitler's head in the post, we still aren't accounting for the number of children that Hitler killed during the entire Holocaust!! That number comes up to 1.5 million. The Holocaust lasted for about 6 years and this would give us a daily average of 685 children murdered per day (1500000/ (6x365)). You see what I'm getting at?

Now let's come back to Netanyahu as promised. This part amuses me even more cuz this is straight up nonsense. As per ""reputable"", Pro-Palestine sources, the number of children that have died in this war is 13,000. For the sake of being unbiased, let's pump those numbers up to account for any children whose deaths aren't accounted for by so called ""reputable"" Pro Palestine sources. So let's add 4000 children more which brings the number up to 17,000 (I hope Pro Palestine supporters are happy with this estimate). The current war has been going on for 139 days and with the same math (17000/139), it would give us a daily average of 122 children murdered per day. It's not even close to the number shown on the Instagram post even after adding 4000 children more!! 

This is a typical example of over-dramatization by Pro Palestine supporters to intentionally depict Israel as the villains. I'm not downplaying the ongoing tragedy that's happening in Gaza. But I hate it when Pro Palestine supporters disregard the sheer atrocities that Hitler committed for the sake of gaining worldwide sympathy for the people of Gaza. He has to be the most evil person that ever existed. 6 MILLION DEATHS!!! If you think Israel-Hamas war is a ""genocide"", then don't try to disregard the Holocaust and the atrocities committed by Hitler because that genocide was of a much greater magnitude.

The people who commented on that post were all riled up and saying stuff like ""Hitler was right all along for what he did to the Jews"", ""Hitler is Netanyahu's idol and now he has surpassed him"", etc.. Like what are you even saying? Do the math for God's sake and stop spreading false information.

Edit 1 : Try avoiding the use of certain words that trigger the automoderator when commenting here.

Edit 2 : My response to the most common theme of comments here are as follows

Question 1 : You're saying that Netanyahu is only a fraction as bad as Hitler and hence the Gaza crisis is justified? 

Answer 1 : Not what I'm trying to say. The picture I'm trying to paint is that by comparing the Holocaust to the Gaza crisis, you are undermining the memories and sufferings of Holocaust victims. The two events are completely disparate and the very idea of putting them up for comparison indicates your callousness towards the Holocaust victims. What's worse is that you're spreading this intentionally misrepresented information all for the sake of gaining sympathy for the people of Gaza. Respect is a two-way street.... If you can't respect the Holocaust victims, then don't expect to gain sympathy or respect for the people of Gaza.

Question 2 : The Holocaust never happened. It's just another Israeli lie.

1b4w8k5,"Pro-Palestinians, why do you support violent resistance? How has violent resistance helped?","While not all pro-Palestinians believe in violent resistance, many do. I see a common theme in their arguments that Palestinian violence is justified as Israel is an occupying/colonial force and that the Palestinians are simply defending their homeland. Many have compared Palestinian resistance movements to the NVA/Vietcong or the FLN in Algeria, and saying it is the only way that Palestinians will get their freedom from Israel.

I am not interested in discussing/debating the morality or justifications for armed resistance, such discussions are simply of no interest to me. If you believe Palestinians are morally justified in attacking Ismael then fair enough. What I am interested in is the results of their resistance.

It seems that every time the Arabs/Palestinians have resisted, it has made things worse for them. In 1948 they resisted and got the nakba, in 1967 they resisted and got the occupation of the west bank and Gaza, in the 1970s/80s the PLO resisted from Lebanon and got Lebanon invaded and occupied. In the 2000s they resisted with the 2nd intifada and got the separation/apartheid wall. Gaza started resisting and got blockaded and bombed. And four months ago we had what many people called the greatest victory for palestine and now we see how that victory is going for them.

Even the ""successful"" resistances like the 1973 war and Hezbollah were just undoing the damage done by previous resistances at the cost of an enormous amount of to Arabs. Egypt lost over 10k soldiers in the war, which they could've avoided by making peace with Ismael before 1967 so they didnt have the Sinai occupied in the first place.  Hezbollah ""won"" in 2006 by getting over 1000 Lebanese killed and their infrastructure destroyed. I feel like it would've been a better victory for Lebanon had they simply not attacked Ismael and provoked Ismael into invading them.

If you believe that its simply a matter of time for the resistance to win, then why so long? Arabs/Palestinians have been resisting Zionism since it began over 100 years ago. it took the Vietnamese 20 years to kick out the Americans and the French.  It took the Algerians about 7 years to kick the French out. It took the afghhans about 9 years to kick the soviets out and 20 to kick the americans out. Yet the Palestinians and Arabs have been fighting Israel/Jews/Zionism, a much weaker enemy than the Americans or French in terms of manpower and equipment, for 100 years, and still fails to defeat them. Even in 1948 when all the Jews had were a bunch of ragtag militias against 6 Arab armies, they failed.

These conditions sound appalling, obviously. However, seeing as how Hamas controls all of the information coming out of the Gaza Strip, and that Palestine and Hamas both have a long history of lying and fabricating atrocities, I wanted to do some more digging. 

Other people on this sub have told me that hundreds of children have starved to death in Gaza, but none of the various websites have been able to identify a single victim, child or adult, who has starved to death. They all, robotically, say the same thing, that Gazans are ""starving to death"", and they've said that for months. I have yet to find any actual statistics or reports about Gazans who have starved to death. Not ""starving"" to death, but starved to death. Shouldn't after all this time, and with all these reporters in Gaza, there should be solid evidence of at least one victim who died of starvation?

[The famine in Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_Yemen_(2016%E2%80%93present), in contrast to Gaza, was only ranked a IPC 3 and 4, vs. Gaza's 5 (5 is the worst, as Mercy Corps said above). During the first year of the famine, children died of starvation at a rate of 130 per day and one every ten minutes. If you Google ""children starving in Yemen"", [you get horrific images like this one.](https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/yemen-hunger-child-ap-ps-181121_hpMain_16x9_1600.jpg) If you Google ""children starving in Gaza"", [you get images of pretty normal looking kids.](https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VPF5BAGWR5JCRLE4KS5ZNR5SDA.jpg) I have a feeling that if Gazans looked like Yemenese victims of starvation, we'd be seeing them all over this sub every single day. 

So that's my ask to you. Can someone please link me up to a news article from a respected third party outlet that gives me some information about anyone who has literally died of starvation in Gaza? Ideally at the levels of evidence demanded by those who deny Israelis were raped on 10/7, please, so the name of the victim, the forensics report, photos, videos, a third party investigation, etc. If millions of people have indeed been starving to death since late October of last year, this ask should be ridiculously easy to complete. 

It's entirely possible that people have starved to death in Gaza. I'm definitely willing to be shown that. But some of the facts don't seem to be adding up and I have yet to see actual proof of what I'm asking for.",08/02/24 14:24:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1alwumn/starvation_deaths_skepticism_in_gaza/,121,452,628,Palestine,top,all
u5swsp,"Dear Western People,","It has come that time again where we need to sit down and chat. I know, I know, you are bored sitting at your crappy desk job, sipping on your third oversized coffee just _dying_ for that clock to strike five. Or maybe you are procrastinating on your homework after a stressful day of classes at your Ivy League school, and masturbating for a third time just doesn’t sound like such a good release at this point. So what better way to get your rocks off than spreading some social justice on the internet?

I understand, my western friend. I really do. We have all been there. Especially your fellow Redditor like myself. We don’t have sex here. That is for your roommate who lifts weights, and isn’t on Reddit 24/7. And who doesn’t like a good cup of coffee? One more _definitely_ won’t hurt us. 

But really, Mr. Westerner, in all seriousness, we need to have an honest conversation. Because right now, we just don’t see eye to eye. There is a disconnect between us. One that drives us further away from your goals of peace. All because you cross the line far too often where your rhetoric no longer is a concern for humanity, but an attack on Jews. 

And we are tired. 

Yes, before you even think it - Israel _does_ deserve its fair share of valid criticism. I’ll just get that part out of the way. Criticizing Israel is not criticizing Jews. Good? Good. But this post isn’t about Israel. It is the way you approach the debate of Israel and Palestine. And let me tell you, Western buddy, it doesn’t look good. 

Like when you [comment about the conflict on a post that has nothing to do with I/P](https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/u4ze5f/jewish_man_shelters_refugees_to_honor_those_who/i51500i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3). Can you guess what that post might be about? You guessed Jews, didn’t you, you beautiful anonymous thing you? Yes, Jews. 

We hear you. Believe me, we _hear_ you. Again and again. Criticizing Israel isn’t criticizing Jews. But why oh _why_ do you conflate Jews and Israel all the time? A huge portion of any Jewish post on non-Jewish subreddits are flooded with hatred towards Israel. And you can’t fathom why Jews always play the victim while labeling you an antisemite for no reason. There is a reason. You create a narrative for every Jew being responsible for the actions you hate in Israel. No longer is your argument against Israel’s government, but demonizing any and all Jews for something they have no part in. 

It pains me to have to drill this point in, but do you get that? The mention of Jew doesn’t open the door for you to spew hatred towards Israel. You wouldn’t blame China for COVID-19 on a post highlighting the accomplishments of an Asian in Canada, would you? Well, maybe you would. But that would be like, totally messed up, dude. And you should be ashamed of yourself.  

I wish we could just stop here and call it a day. But no, you have taken further steps towards antisemitism that can’t be ignored, my Western guy. Like when you make [comparisons to a certain WWII event](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/tyrhss/people_running_away_from_a_palestinian_mass/i3xo36i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3). You do this so often, that mods here even had to make a rule against doing so. And you do it knowingly because of what we, as Jews, have been through. 

I’ll be blunt, if you believe Israel is _currently_ committing genocide, you need to go learn what actual genocide looks like. No, really. Go to a holocaust museum and see the horrors for yourself. Go see what the extermination of a people looks like. There is no comparison. 

This isn’t to say the Palestinian people aren’t wronged in any way. But their plight is very different than the plight of Jews in WWII. Comparing the two will _never_ garner you any support with Jews. You’ll lose all credibility in your argument for your lack of knowledge in history. And ironically, you are just adding to the conflict instead of being a proponent for solving it. 

You see, my Western partner, we take notice in your words. We know your thinly veiled antisemitism behind your attempts at anti-Zionism. We aren’t stupid. 

We see it in your [condemnations of Muslims rioting in Sweden](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/u5muwy/third_day_of_car_burning_and_rioting_happening_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), but [sympathize with terrorists in Israel](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/tro3a9/palestinians_celebrating_the_terrorist_attacks_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). It is clear the double standard that you hold has nothing to do with policy, but rather bigotry. When it comes to your own countries, any violence brings out your obvious hatred towards Muslims. Yet when it comes to Israel, it is the [victims’ of the attackers fault](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tyjkn8/at_least_five_wounded_in_tel_aviv_shooting_attack/i3teefd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3). They deserved it. Because they are Jews. 

And we are tired. 

So for those of you who truly mean well but just do not understand the damage you cause with poorly chosen words, take heed. [You can be a proponent for change, and be part of the solution](https://www.seedsofpeace.org/about/our-services/). At the end of the day, it is going to be both Israeli Jews and Palestinians youths of tomorrow to bring peace to the conflict. Not you, living continents away. But you can help. You can be an ally, my Western friend. 

To those of you doing a horrible job of hiding your antisemitism, you can stop pretending. We know you. You’re hurting Palestinians in the hate you spew. Though, it is apparent you do not care about them either in the way you regurgitate your bigotry at the Muslims of Sweden. We are not falling for any of your tricks, my Western non-friend. So you might as well just come out of the closet.",17/04/22 18:21:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/u5swsp/dear_western_people/,118,168,925,Palestine,top,all
18e3oz5,"Ghosted by best friend after a disagreement on the war and ""genocide""...","My best friend of 8+ years recently completely stopped talking to me after a lengthy conversation regarding Israel and Palestine, and more specifically, the term ""genocide"" being used to describe the situation. 

**TLDR:** My ex-friend thinks Israel is committing genocide. She thinks Hamas is not committing genocide because (1) the scale of Israelis they have killed is too small; and (2) they would never be successful.

I would appreciate input on the conversation. If I am mistaken on anything or should've said something different, I would like to know. 

**Context**: Her little sister signed an alumni letter to the board of her former high school describing Israel as an apartheid state that is committing genocide against Palestinians. The letter and the names of all who signed was leaked on Twitter. 

My friend was extremely upset that her sister ""was doxxed"". She did not share the full letter with me and asked me to not look it up. 

**Me:** Israel is not committing genocide because (1) this is a war and people die in wars and (2) if this was really a genocide, wouldn't Israel be rounding up the Arab population of Israel and mass murdering them?

**Her:** (1) this is a genocide because it is an asymmetrical war and the people of Gaza do not stand a chance and (2) the Geneva Convention defines genocide as a ""crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or ***in part.***"" Israel is committing genocide specifically toward the people in Gaza.

**Me:** (1) Was the Afghanistan War also a genocide? (asymmetrical) 

**Her:** No, because of the ""mental"" and ""physical"" elements (Geneva Convention), cites extremist Israelis who have called for the complete destruction of Gaza, and then the actual destruction of much of Gaza.

**Me:** (2) Given your definition of genocide, wouldn't Hamas be committing genocide against Israelis? 

i) if it can be just *in part,* the initial attack killed 1000+ Israelis. 

ii) the mental part is clear, the foundational documents of Hamas are genocidal, and there are extremists on Hamas' side who also call for the complete destruction of Israel. 

iii) the physical part is also clear, they went in and tried to kill as many Israelis as they could. 

**Her:** *Obviously* Hamas can't be committing genocide because (1) the scale of how many Israelis they have killed is too small and (2) they would never be successful.

**Me:** (1) Can you give me a number of how many it would take for you to call it a genocide? (2) Hitler wasn't successful, was the Holocaust not a genocide?

**Her:** (1) That's impossible and an unfair question. 

\-----------------

Anyways... I tried my best to be calm, although she was continuously blatantly disrespectful throughout. 

She proceeded to ask me for space, and then broke her Instagram silence posting dozens of infographics and war videos. 

I have not heard from her since :(. I miss her a lot, but honestly this engagement made me lose a lot of respect I had for her. I hope one day we can make up, but she lives in a bubble and I was her only friend who opposed her in any way.

1b0tuwt,"Genocidal quotes from Hamas, Palestinian Authority, Iran and Hezbollah","For 75 years Arabs have been actively trying to destroy Israel and murder its civilians!

In 1937 and 1947, Arabs rejected two partition plans to share the land.

In 1948, six Arab armies invaded the newly formed Israel with the goal to “throw the Jews into the sea”, they failed and many Palestinians fled on their own accord, and many stayed (20% of Israeli citizens are Arab).

For the next 30 years and multiple wars, Arab armies tried to destroy Israel and rejected peace such as with the 1967 Alon Plan. This went on until 1980.

PLO terrorists then took over with the goal of destroying Israel from 1960s. They sent their message out by hijacking planes, shooting up hotel guests and a school bus amongst other nightmare crimes against humanity.

They terrorized until the 1990 Oslo Accords when the Palestinian Authority was formed to replace them, although they recognised Israel they too rejected peace plans to form a state in 2000 and 2008.

From then on the goal of destroying Israel was passed onto Hamas. They murdered 803 civilians by suicide bombings from 1993 – 2006.

In 2005 Israel left Gaza, Palestinians then held an election and voted this extremist Hamas into power, who switched to firing rockets from Gaza. Over 55,000 rockets and mortars have been fired at Israeli civilians since then, bringing rounds of response from the IDF upon Gazans.

October 7th crossed all red lines in its sickening murder of 1200, and kidnapping of 242.

The Arab goal of wanting to destroy Israel and murdering its civilians is the root of this conflict.

Israel does not have a peace partner. This should be evident from the thousands of terrorist attacks of Palestinians over the last 100 years on the land against Jews and from 25 years of wars by Arab nations from 1948 - 1973. But to erase all doubt here it is from the words of their leaders:

“On this occasion, dear brothers and sisters, we cannot but recall the crimes of these criminal [Jews] throughout history. Today, we present the world with a bunch of questions, and we challenge it to answer them honestly, for today, interests overshadow moral values, elections overshadow principles, and Zionism has overshadowed the truth. We ask the people of the world today: Why did France, in 1253, expel and uproot the Jewish entity, which was represented by the ghetto? Why did they expel them? Because they sucked the blood of the French, because they shed the blood of the French, slaughtered them, stole their money, and conspired against them. At the end of the day, the French had no choice but to expel them in 1253. The [Jews] fled north, to Britain, and lived there for only 27 years, until the English realized the criminality of these people, who murdered them, sucked their blood, and stole their money. So they slaughtered hem, and expelled them in 1280. This was not something new — it started even before 1253, on the day that Pharaoh the tyrant expelled them because they had shed the blood of the Egyptians, and had conspired with their enemies against them. So [Pharaoh] expelled them, after they lost their religion, after the time of Joseph.

The series of expulsions continues to this day. Blood continues to be shed, martyrs continue to fall, our sons continue to hoist the banner high, and Allah willing, their expulsion from Palestine in its entirety is certain to come. We are no weaker or less honorable than the peoples that expelled and annihilated the Jews. The day we expel them is drawing near. The nation that opens up its doors, its hearts, and its homes to the [Jews] who were expelled from all corners of the earth was the Islamic nation. We extended our hands to feed these hungry dogs and wild beasts, and they devoured our fingers. We have learned the lesson — there is no place for you among us, and you have no future among the nations of the world. You are headed to annihilation.”
Al-Aqsa TV (Hamas official channel), November 5, 2010

“If the enemy sets foot on a single square inch of Islamic land, Jihad becomes an individual duty, incumbent on every Muslim, male or female. A woman may set out [on Jihad] without her husband’s permission, and a servant without his master’s permission. Why? In order to annihilate those Jews. Oh Allah, destroy the Jews and their supporters. Oh Allah, destroy the Americans and their supporters. Oh Allah, count them one by one, and kill them all, without leaving a single one.”

If [Arab] mobilization would begin for the liberation of Jerusalem; if money [spent] and swords drawn in the face of the Zionist enemy, that would be great. Until now we don’t have nuclear weapons. Believe me, if we had nuclear weapons we would use them tomorrow morning.”

“The ‘Jewish state.’ What is a ‘Jewish state?’ We call it, the ‘State of Israel’. You can call yourselves whatever you want. But I will not accept it.

Jerusalem Post, June 22, 2017

“The Palestinian intifada continues to gallop forward in a thunderous manner so that it can achieve its other goals until the complete liberation of Palestine. The problem with ‘compromise’ is that it… does not take into account the expansionist, oppressive and greedy characteristics of the Zionists”

“[Israel] ridicules and violates all laws and humanitarian values… Following World War II they resorted to military aggression to make an entire nation homeless on the pretext of Jewish suffering… [The Jews] sent migrants from Europe, the US and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in occupied Palestine…So long as Zionist domination continues, many countries, governments and nations will never be able to enjoy freedom, independence and security.”

Hossein Salami, Deputy IRGC Commander:

“We are creating might in Lebanon because we want to fight our enemy from there with all our strength. Hezbollah today has tremendous might on the ground that can on its own break the Zionist regime… Today an international Islamic army has been formed in Syria, and the voices of the Muslims are heard near the Golan.

12rstm5,My Grandmother Is Older Than Israel,"A talking point that is beloved by Palestine supporters on Twitter and elsewhere is ""my grandmother is older than Israel."" [Here's an example.](https://twitter.com/Nadia_Shammas_/status/1392333481791922181) It's extremely common. 

This talking point is a good example of the kind of intellectual dishonesty and moral inconsistency that is so common among pro-Palestine talking points. Their point is that because Israel is a young state, that means it shouldn’t exist? I guess? Or that its legitimacy is in question because of its age? I'm honestly not sure, but the talking point is spammed constantly, usually on pro-Israel tweets, so I assume it's some kind of ""gotcha"" for Zionists. 

Taken at face value, the Israel they're talking about is the State of Israel (as opposed to the land of Israel or the concept of Israel or Israel Kamakawiwo’ole) which was founded in 1948. If that is the case, then yes, their grandmother is most likely older than Israel, as I’m sure are a lot of people’s grandparents. Why this is problematic I have no idea, but they seem to think so.

But what’s funny is then these same Palestine supporters don't apply their own logic and standards to their own beloved Palestine. If Israel is 75 years old, having been founded in 1948, and not as old as your grandmother, then Palestine is only 35 years old, as the state of Palestine was founded in 1988. Which means forget about your grandmother, I'M older than Palestine, and so are half of millennials. 

Another state that is currently fighting for its survival, Ukraine, only gained independence in 1991, which means it’s younger than Palestine and is barely old enough to drink. Vladimir Putin is older than Ukraine. For some reason such logic doesn’t apply here.

As always, Palestine supporters hold Israel to one standard and Palestine to an entirely different one. If Israel has no or little legitimacy because your grandmother is older than it, then Palestine has twice as little legitimacy because it's half Israel's age. It’s pretty clear these kinds of talking points are used only because they sound good, not because they are factually true or make even a lick of sense.",19/04/23 13:11:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/12rstm5/my_grandmother_is_older_than_israel/,116,203,358,Palestine,top,all

17p1vzl,Why are palestine supporters always so aggressive?,"I know the people who support hamas do it because they think they’re on the side of the victims, that they’re against murder, even if they’re not completely right and mostly viewing this war from an ignorant point of view. 
But if they call themselves the empathetic ones, the ones defending life, and overall against any kind of harm to human beings, why are they happy about the suffering of Israelis?

Every pro-palestine person i’ve seen (on twitter) is pretty much dismissing the suffering of Israelis of straight up celebrating the tragedies they’re going trough, in real life they’re harassing innocent jewish people who have done nothing wrong simply to “support palestine”, and they are aggressive towards every person who gives any information about this war that isn’t defending, justifying or victimizing hamas. 

At the start I assumed they just wanted to be a part of the majority because if the majority supports palestine then palestine is in the right, right? but as the weeks pass, I notice these people who claim to be good humans, have a strong, deathly hatred towards jewish people and Israelis, they want them death.

Why does this happen? has the world always felt this way about about Israel? how can society hate a group of people so much that they even think it’s a progressive take openly say that Israelis should leave the only land they can call their home, and wishing death and suffering upon them?

Former Palestine supporter, now Israeli supporter. It wasn't until I travelled to Israel, first in 2012 and then in 2022 that my eyes were opened. It is NOT an apartheid state. It is a great, but greatly misunderstood country.

It wasn't until I sat down with both Arab Jews and Muslims and Israeli Jews and Muslims that I realised that the world has been spun a massive lie. It is frustrating that Israel remains the most misunderstood country on the planet. 

Yes, it has made bad political and conflict decisions, but it is a safe place (until recently) where you can practice any religion, wear whatever you want to wear and enjoy sex whichever way you want.

I know the Palestinians have it tough- but unfortunately thats what some radical extremists do- make their population uneducated, poor and desperate and they succumb to the cult of Free Palestine. Palestine needs to be freed from Hamas and Hezbollah before there is any peace.

My mother is not speaking to me at the moment (she is emotionally abusive so its nothing new) because of my stance and refuses to even consider the possibility she needs to learn more. I have a work colleague who is a Muslim and even though I really like her socially, she is very staunchly pro Palestine. Shes not speaking to me either. Sigh :(   And I understand that, I do.

u3c0t7,Why do Palestinians and their supporters simultaneously threaten and play victim?,"There's a trend I've noticed. Many Palestinians and their supporters will say things like ""no justice no peace"". They'll praise attacks, the message they send out is ""we will keep hounding you as long as you stay on our land"", saying Zionists will never see peace until they give into Palestinian demands, etc.

Then, when Israel responds, they complain of disproportionate force, ""it's so unfailr, look at the disparity in death and destruction"", complaining endlessly about how the evil Zionists kill innocent Palestinian children.

An example is during the recent spate of attacks, on Twitter it's like a parallel universe. You see glorification of these attacks alongside statements like ""get out of Palestine"", threats of eternal war until we leave, and then during IDF military operations in the West Bank, you see them crying about people killed by the IDF (who typically turn out to be members of militant organizations), now the latest fad is the victimhood story of the poor innocent child Ahmad Mansara who is in prison for stabbing a Jewish teenager, alongside stuff like ""how dare they attack us on Ramadan??!!!""

Supporters of the Palestinian cause should be honest. If you want eternal conflict to push us out, this is what you'll get.

Therefore I can imagine how life will be in north Gaza. 
But in this situation there is a culprit (not like blaming Mother Earth), the Hamas and the undue answer of Israel are. Why the people of Gaza don’t walk against Hamas? Why they don’t stand up for their right of peace? Why there is no demonstration? 

This is serious question, because I grow up when peaceful demonstrations lead to the breakdown of a whole political system and no one knew if they would come back alive from a demonstration.

nerjit,Propaganda on people who lack critical thinking,"Hi, quick intro. I'm from Singapore which is majority Chinese, followed by a Malay and Indian minority. The Chinese and Indians in my country generally don't care about the IP conflict. However on the other hand, the Malays are rabid defenders of Palestine and absolutely hate Israel.

Recently I came across one of my ex colleagues posts. He has been expressing support for Palestine and recently he shared a video which had the caption ""pray for falestine"".

https://www.facebook.com/100041763067612/posts/600842931317804?sfns=mo

I watched it a bit...realized very quickly that it didn't look like Palestine. Halfway through the name ""Al Assad"" was mentioned. At the end of the video there was a split second where the caption said ""This is what goes on in Syria every day"". Multiple footages have a logo that literally says ""Live From Syria"".

Then I read the comments. 15,000 shares and...I couldn't even find a single person that pointed out the entire footage is from Syria! The comments were all about ""fuck Israel"" and ""pray for Palestine"", and a whole lot of advocating for genocide.

I mean jesus fucking christ, the word Syria is literally plastered all over. Apparently nobody seem to even wonder why Al Assad was mentioned. How did more than 15,000 people view it and just accept it as the indisputable truth without even questioning the source?!

I'm not Israeli but it scares and disheartens me to see how fake propaganda spreads several times faster than real information even when all the evidence is in your face. How does one even fight a propaganda battle where people believe pretty much any bullshit video regardless of how dubious it is?

nkh5is,I never realized just how close we are,"Out of pure curiousity, today I decided to learn how to read Hebrew. For context, I am a diaspora Palestinian that speaks Arabic. I already knew that both Hebrew and Arabic belonged to the Semetic family, so some letters looking and sounding similar was no surprise. But when I actually began to attempt read Hebrew text, I gained a true perspective of just how close our languages are. I was surprised to find that I could understand about every other word. It was never a one to one comparison, and always took a bit of thinking, but I could usually decipher a word's Arabic equivalent. Not to mention, the similarities of our writing systems only furthers the mutual intelligibility. Never under the Latin alphabet could I draw the line between ""'eretz"" and ""'ard"". Yet ארץ and أرض being the same seemed almost obvious. 

Being able to read and understand large amounts of Hebrew while only knowing Arabic was a true eye opener for me. It made me realize that we are all a lot more alike than we'd like to admit. And while I'm sure that I wouldn't be able to actually comprehend a full speed Hebrew conversation (maybe unless they have a strong Mizrahi accent), my experience today has really cemented that we're all brothers and sisters in the end. سلام/שלום!",25/05/21 04:32:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nkh5is/i_never_realized_just_how_close_we_are/,602,90,222,Palestinian,top,all

Like they spew this stuff that they're just repeating from millenial TikTokers covering the conflict. From talking to my brother, cousins, and friends, I realize that Palestinians born abroad (me in the USA) have no knowledge of the history of the conflict.


I often see comments along the lines, ""The Palestinians saved you people from the Holocaust, accepted you into their land, and you betrayed them."" Like, what? In fact, my brother also told me this the other day. Where did you get this history lesson from? I hear this kind of saintly polishing of Palestinian history a lot. So... we ran some humanitarian effort to save the Jews from the Holocaust? Lol. I saved several screenshots of such comments, but unfortunately, image attachments aren't enabled in this sub.
 

A foreign power ruled over our people (Britain) and forced mass immigration into our land at the time. Our people got violent. It's understandable that they revolted and were unaccepting of immigrants flooding into their land led by a foreign colonial power, especially when they were expecting sovereignty from the British like our Arab neighbors got.


Then I see channels like Middle East Eye recounting the events that led to the conflict; they start with the Belfour declaration and then just skip to the Nakba. We're just going to skip 30 years of back-and-forth violence that led to the '48 war. It was a war, by the way, that we lost badly. The Jews didn't wake up one day and barge into every Palestinian home to kick them out.


However, it seems any honest recount of history or critique of Palestinian history gets met with me being called a traitor. I'm just saying that our people back in the 1900s acted like any community would if a foreign power forced societal changes on them. There's no reason to paint us as saints.

Of course Israel is stronger

They need to be stronger and win - since they have an enemy of Islamist lunatics who want to kill non-muslims

On the flip side - with all its military strength - Israel may have devastated Gaza in a single day at any point within the past few decades

But it hasn't - since they do not want to

They're attempting to oversee and discover a way to create peace with dreadful devout nutters who do not want peace

The so-called “genocide” has really been gigantic Palestinian populace development over the years

And within this war where individuals will die, (as we understand and acknowledge happens in all wars that do not include Israel), to do its best to avoid Palestinian civilians getting caught up, (civilians that Hamas Needs to die for publicity), Israel Warns their enemy when and where they are going to attack…

Think how crazy that is?

In a war israel must win - it Cautions its enemies when and where it's going to attack - helping its enemies and disadvantaging itself - so that it can do the best within its capability to protect civilians

Israel is in a extreme circumstance

Attempting to make peace with a society of Islamic fundamentalists that believes that assaulting women is sacred and  is grinned upon by Allah

No one would do better than Israel

Commentators can live in their world of perfect ideas where they never have to really make choices and act - where the stake at risk is your very survival - but Israel doesn't have that freedom

It is constrained continually to come out of the comfort zone of conversation and imagination and act to spare its people from an evil and nauseating enemy that assaulted and killed over a thousand men, women and children and who say without shame that their objective is to do it again and again and again… ",16/03/24 10:27:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bg31ow/palestinians_and_genocide/,171,896,377,Palestinian,top,all
1aeul86,"After the ""return to Gaza conference"" - can you finally understand why Palestinians hate / fear us?","We really want to paint it in black and white, portray ourselves as the ultimate good guys, and them as the ultimate bad guys.

And while it's true, Hamas is the bad guy, I am not saying anything to try and defend them or their action.

There were many calls in Israel about ""Why gazans don't rebel against them?"" and one of the answers is that they have no where to turn to, some of us want to believe that they view us as the good guys, and Hamas as the bad. The truth is they view us both as evils, and need to choose one evil over the other.

Why they view us as evils? Because it's a legitimate ""opinion"" to hold on Israel that ""we should kill all arabs"", while it's true the IDF don't recklessly kill innocent, lot of people in Israel wish they would, and the other part don't jump to defend them. It became so norm that people who formally said it, and still repeat it are now ministers, and they keep saying it, and they stay ministers. It is obvious that if an arab Knesset member will publicly call to ""kill all jews"" or say that ""we should burn Bnei Brak"" he will be arrested, and removed from office.

Now put yourselves at the shoes of an average citizen of Gaza, from the one hand there is Hamas, they steal from them, they abuse them, they take their freedom. From the other side there's Israel, you see that there's a legitimate conference in Israel where they literally call to kill you and remove you from your lands, literally. Ministers, members of the ruling party stand on stage and calls to KILL you, the PM defends it and calls it ""freedom of speech"". Why would they choose Israel or even think of Israel as the lesser evil from their view point??

We are not the good guys in this story, we might not be as bad as they claim us to be, but there are too many people who wish for us to be as bad.",30/01/24 17:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1aeul86/after_the_return_to_gaza_conference_can_you/,171,747,351,Palestinian,top,all

Contrary to the ""indiscriminate bombing"" and ""Palestinian genocide"" narrative that people love to spew, the strategy behind Israel's approach to the war is being revealed and it's brilliant:

1) Use precision bombing to destroy Hamas infrastructure, drive them underground, and destroy escape tunnels

2) Send ground forces in to encircle Gaza City (where Hamas is concentrated) and control the exit points

3) Open up a humanitarian corridor to evacuate remaining civilians while Hamas remains hidden underground

17t2ige,White people are deciding where jews are indigenous to?!,"Aside from all the open antisemitism I have been seeing, I have been feeling gaslit with all these videos of white people looking at Ashkenazi and assuming they are white Europeans and have no ties to Israel.

Where is the ""do not assume my genetics!?""

Why is it that white people get to decide when jews are not white and when they are white!?

I think its horrible to feel the need to equate Jewish-ness with genetics and ties to the levant, but feeling gas lit, and seeing videos with millions of views claiming Ashkenazi are indigenous to Europe, I embarked on my own quest to identify what link I have other than familial stories of exile out of the levant, I have found that I - an olive/white Ashkenazi have maternal and paternal haplotypes that are shared with 70% of the Bedouins, 50% of Palestinians, and 30% of Egyptian and Syrians, but <1% of Europeans. My grandparents immigrated from Germany and Russia.

Many Palestinians and jews share common ancestors and are really decedents of the same people - this makes the entire conflict all the more tragic.

There is scientific evidence (since a lot of people are ignoring historical and archeological evidence) that proves that proves that Ashkenazi are not Europeans.

what kind of implications does assuming genetics and indigeneity have on other minorities?

At what point, does a person with Apache ancestry cease to be an Apache because they now live in Florida or moved overseas?

how many generations does it take to sever ties to your homeland and make you indigenous to your current region?

If my ancestors left the middle east 500 years ago, are we approaching the point where the settlers in the Americas have become indigenous?

There is a dangerous double standard being created by white people yet again that is going to inevitably end up harming minorities...

Why have progressive narratives ceased to apply to someone because they are Jewish?

Also - I do want to say that Judaism is a complex cultural and religious identity and genetics alone should not define, but those claiming Ashkenazi have no ties to the region are plain wrong.",11/11/23 20:02:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17t2ige/white_people_are_deciding_where_jews_are/,153,416,362,Palestinian,top,all

Here's an excerpt from their exchange:

> But in the days since, as new evidence contradicting the Hamas claim has emerged, the Gazan authorities have changed their story about the blast. Spokespeople have released death tolls varying from 500 to 833, before settling on 471.
\
The Hamas-run health ministry has also declined to release further details about those 471 victims, and all traces of the munition have seemingly vanished from the site of the blast, making it impossible to assess its provenance. Raising further questions about Hamas’s claims, the impact site turned out to be the hospital parking lot, and not the hospital itself.
\
On Sunday, Hamas turned down requests by The Times to view any available evidence of the munition it said had struck the hospital, claiming that it had disintegrated beyond recognition.
\
“The missile has dissolved like salt in the water,” said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, in a phone interview. “It’s vaporized. Nothing is left.”
\
Salama Maroof, the head of the Hamas-run government media office, said in a text message: “Who says we’re obligated to present the remnants of every rocket that kills our people? In general, you can come and research and confirm for yourself from the evidence we possess.” [...] \
\
The military also said that Palestinian armed groups had mistakenly fired more than 550 rockets into their own territory since the war began more than two weeks ago. The claim could not be immediately verified but Palestinian groups have previously acknowledged that their rockets land in Gaza; video last year showed one zigzagging through the air shortly after launch, before plummeting into a civilian area.

“We have made mistakes, I am not going to deny it,” said Musab Al-Breim, a spokesman for Islamic Jihad, in an interview on Wednesday. “However, not mistakes of this size.”",23/10/23 10:47:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17ehgt2/hamas_evidence_of_the_munition_that_struck_alahli/,149,135,321,Palestinian,top,all

A friend was in the vehicle with him, he said they got to the car and tried to flee, saw dozens of bodies lying in the floor, they went past a burnt car when a terrorist started spraying at them. The driver friend got shot in the arm, my best friend got shot in the head and begged for help that didn’t come in time, the friend who survived tried to resuscitate him to no avail, he suffered for three hours barely conscious begging to be saved until he died. The army eventually came and evacuated the driver friend. He now has to live with his best friend dying in his arms whilst tripping on psychedelics, being unable to help.
Fuck Hamas. To all those saying shoot them in the head, Fuck that. Torture them for years before they get the release of death.

1ahqzgr,How the western world views radical islam,"The west needs to stop thinking that its core values are in line with radical Islam.  

You see, in the civilized world, we have some core beliefs. For example, if you treat someone with respect and dignity, they will reciprocate. 

The thing is, radical Islam does not share that value. 

You can treat a radical Islamist with all the dignity in the world but you’re still an infidel and they want you dead, irrelevant of how you treat them. 

The west needs to understand that radical Islam’s war is not about land, human rights, or anything else other than a religious ideological war on everything we believe in. 

We like to give them fancy names like Hamas, Hezbolloh, Houthis, ISIS, Islamic Jihad, etc. 

You can call them whatever you want, it’s all the same garbage. You can march for them day and night, but don’t kid yourself to think that if they have a chance to bring October 7th to a theater near you, that they’d hesitate for a second. They wouldn’t, and if Israel doesn’t defeat Hamas in this war, they won’t! The west is next! 

The thing is, it’s not politically correct to say it, but radical Islam is a global plague. This isn’t about Israel. This isn’t about land. This isn’t about a state. This is about dead Jews and the defeat of the west. 

Another example, which took me years to internalize, is that, in the west, we have morals. We have ethics. We have red lines that we would never cross. There are some things that are NEVER ok. 

That is not the case for radical Islam. It’s time we internalize this. For them, rape is ok. Pedophilia is ok. Mutilating bodies is ok. Burning families is ok. Decapitating babies is ok. They have NO red lines. 

The most tragic part of it all is the indoctrination of children who are taught to murder infidels from age zero. 

You cannot make peace with an ideology that believes you do not have a right to exist. 

It’s really time the west understands that taking their values and applying them to the world of radical Islam is both ridiculous and dangerous. 

Just like no moral person thought that making peace with the Nazis was a good idea… Just like everyone understood that Germany had to be denazified, even if it entailed many innocent lives lost, the same is true for societies run by radical
Islam.  There is no fixing them. It’s ingrained from before they can talk… 

It’s time we stopped speaking our language and started speaking theirs. 

That is the only way we can effectively battle the plague of radical Islam that is slowly destroying us from the inside.",03/02/24 07:56:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ahqzgr/how_the_western_world_views_radical_islam/,146,499,453,Hamas,top,all

194bw58,"According to South Africa, 662,400,000 people in Gaza are starving.","Among all of the falsities claimed in the hearing against Israel put forth by South Africa, this has to be the most shocking. Here is the direct quote from the hearing:

>Of all the people in the world currently suffering catastrophic hunger, more than 80% are in Gaza. 

Now this is obviously easily disprovable [as shown here](https://www.worldvision.org/hunger-news-stories/world-hunger-facts) given that ~828 __million__ people are suffering from starvation in the world.

> Hunger is worsening worldwide. As many as 828 million people — about 10% of the global population — regularly go to bed hungry. Economic shocks, extreme weather events, and conflicts like the war in Ukraine have restricted global food supplies, driven up prices, and presented a threat to vulnerable populations and countries.

 ~10% of the world population. And South Africa would have us believe that 8% of the world population is in Gaza. Let’s even given the benefit of the doubt that this number is disputable that maybe these aren’t all in danger of death from starvation. There is still a long ways to go from any number you can come up with from Gaza and hundreds of millions world-wide. 

This is astronomically insane, and brings to question what the motives of South Africa is here. This is just a demonstration of hatred and slander against Israel not based in reality. There are a whole metric boatload of real problems that could be pointed to that are shrouded in moral ambiguity that takes place in war, and this one in particular. They are mind boggling choosing to live in an alternate reality and deciding to blatantly lie in front of the highest court of justices. 

They could have just stopped at the truth: regardless of where the fault lays, there is starvation in Gaza and a humanitarian crisis that needs to be fixed. They wouldn’t though, as this is more than a tribunal for them, it is a vendetta. [One of alliance with Hamas](https://www.sajr.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/anc-hamas.jpg). One of a lack of education in understanding the invoking of “Amalek,” for example. One of history as Israel didn’t impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa and were perceived as supporting it. 

This is going to be a huge test for the international community of maintaining reputation, and I fear they will fail to partiality of their politics as most of the UN has. I hope not, but if they let these lies go unaccounted for and without making an example of what happens when you lie to the ICJ, future precedence will detrimentally be changed. 

These claims need to be tossed out for exactly what they are: horribly slanderous lies. It is a mockery of the court otherwise.

~377,800 level-5 in Gaza.

~600,000 level-5 worldwide.

Those numbers are still off from 80% by ~20%. Still a mischaracterization of data. Still a lie. This is the ICJ they are speaking to, not some social media forum. They need to be accurate with these numbers otherwise it hurts their case. If they said they were comparing projected numbers, fine as well. But they didn’t, they are pointing to right now.

&#x200B;

As we already know that Hamas doesn't care at all about lives of Gaza's civilians (https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-hamas-official-claims-group-is-not-responsible-for-defending-gazan-civilians/) , this is certainly part of the reason that Hamas is so desperate for a ceasefire that will allow them to remain in power. The intelligence trove here will likely keep Mossad busy for months, if not years. And Hamas doesn't want the IDF destroying any more of its terror infrastructure. 

If Hamas cared about civilians in Gaza, they'd be negotiating surrender in exchange for passage out of Gaza (as was done with Arafat and the PLO in Beirut in 1982). But they're counting on the international community to force Israel to allow them to remain in Gaza. 

And UNRWA""s claims that they had no idea this was going on are not in any way credible: 

""The IDF also said that in some of the offices of UNRWA officials, troops found equipment and documents that indicated “that the same offices were also used by Hamas terrorists.”  
“There is no doubt that UNRWA staff knew that \[Hamas\] was digging a massive tunnel beneath them,” Aharon said. “There’s a perimeter wall, a gate, cameras, at the gate they log who comes in and out. Whoever worked at UNRWA knew very well who was coming in, and who they were covering for.”""

&#x200B;

Bottom line:  UNRWA is fatally compromised and needs to be disbanded. Responsibility (and funding) for its operations needs to be redirected to the UNHCR, which is responsible for all other refugees on the planet. UNHCR needs to exercise its mandate to resettle refugees when return is not an option.   The overwhelming majority of Palestinian ""refugees"" are actually not refugees as defined by the UNHCR (""someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion"") because their ""country of origin"" isn't Israel if they weren't ever living there. But it would seem reasonable to allow UNHCR to provide services for a period of X (5? 10?) years to these non-refugees to assist them in resettlement.

18bcp7e,Close review of Gaza casualty figures reported by UN OCHA based on Hamas proves they are FALSIFIED.,"🧵Critical Thread. Close review of Gaza casualty figures reported by UN OCHA based on daily Hamas “Ministry of Health” numbers proves they are FALSIFIED. Women & children are grossly inflated. This is easily proven but media ignores. See detailed expose below:

UN OCHA publishes a daily “flash update” since Oct 8 and cites detailed Gaza casualty figures provided by Hamas. The website and data is available to the public here: Sometime in October the UN provided the data in graphic form, here is the latest.  [ochaopt.org/crisis](https://ochaopt.org/crisis)

It is immediately obvious that Hamas does not report ANY combatant deaths & the numbers amazingly seem to indicate that IDF bombs & bullets disproportionately hit women, children & elderly. They IDF CANNOT seem to hit too many fighting age men. But the numbers are faked.

It first becomes apparent on Oct 19 reporting where Hamas reports 3,785 deaths vs 3,478 prior day or +307. But children killed magically move up from 853 to 1,524 or +671. Oct 18 reporting deaths were 25% children but next day it jumps to 40%! UN published detail is below: 

No explanation is given. There is no adjustment at later dates. The running count continues from 1,524 until today. No questioning, no skepticism from UN, NGOs or media on how the children killed number jumps all of a sudden. But there are more falsifications at later dates.

Oct 26 Hamas reported 7,028 fatalities vs 6,547 prior day or +481. Remarkably women & children killed jump by +626 that same day! (See my math in blue below). No men died that day apparently. Again, no hint of shame or skepticism by UN to publish these Hamas numbers.

More Hamas fabricated numbers. October 29 +302 new fatalities were reported but somehow comprised of +199 women and +129 children which comes to +328 or 26 more than total fatalities! (My math shown in blue) Men came back to life? But sure, let’s rely on these statistics. 

More daily lies. On Oct 31, 8,525 reported fatalities vs 8,309 prior day or +216. New fatalities of women & children were +210. (Detail for Oct 30 presented by UN in text format). Which means ONLY SIX men of any age were killed that day! That’s 2.8% of that day's fatalities! 8/

There’s more. On Nov 7 Hamas reported 10,328 total fatalities vs 10,022 prior day or +306. New fatalities of women & children +302. Which means ONLY FOUR men of any age were killed that day! That’s 1.3% of that day's fatalities. This is what NGOs & UN rely upon. 

Another unmentioned changed: as of Nov 20 “Ministry of Health” stopped reporting numbers and since then it’s the “Media Office” taking charge. Hamas is not even pretending that these numbers are reliable anymore repost to media outlets to expose these lies.

17nuzkb,Our humanity is being weaponized,"As someone who considers myself a progressive American democrat, I’ve had a lot of reckoning to do these last several weeks. At one point, I was calling for a ceasefire, until I realized our humanity is being weaponized with the goal of making us antisemitic. 

After listening to arguments on all sides, I’ve never been more certain that Israel needs to exist. The claims that it needs to be dismantled has a lot of propaganda behind it, but when you dig deep enough, it’s usually highly antisemitic and doesn’t have anything to do with Palestinian liberation. 

I have a lot of progressive friends and live in a very liberal state, but I am utterly horrified that people I once considered relatively normal are becoming antisemitic and I don’t even think they realize it. Here’s my take on what’s happening: 

1. Hamas and many Palestinians want to eradicate Israel. They do not want to live peacefully with Jews. Most are antisemitic although they will share more sanitary claims about freedom instead of what they truly believe, which is usually antisemitic at its core. People like to cite the Hamas rebrand from 2017, claiming it is now a liberation group, and “from the river to the sea” is now rebranded as a call for freedom.  

2. Hamas knew this brutal attack would lead to the biggest war in Gaza yet. They strategically built their HQ under Al Shifa hospital and other civilian infrastructure so Israel would look horrible when they bombed it. This would contribute to antisemitism and damage Israel’s credibility, pushing more people to be pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel. 

3. People on the far left are generally very empathetic and humanatarian. Watching the horrors unfold in Gaza in HD through Instagram is really deeply affecting people. It’s affecting all of us, but I also understand why it needs to be done. For most empaths and humanitarians, it’s impossible to rationally justify any death, and therefore, because the bombardment has been live and well documented (more than the attack on Oct. 7) their humanity has become weaponized. Instead of calling for Hamas to release the hostages, they have turned against the Jewish people, calling them colonizers. Zionist is the new white supremacist. They only want the bloodshed to stop because it’s harming their own lived experience. If this was really about their care of Palestinians and social justice, they’d be equally screaming about the other genocides happening around the world. Which brings us back to antisemitism. 

4. People calling the mass casualties a genocide have a political motivation, which is to  radicalize and weaponize our humanity. It’s very interesting to observe that Israel is the only country in the world that is critiqued for how it conducts a war. General Patreous in the U.S. said there is no war that comes close for comparison — you have to go back to WWII for some rare battles that come close to what we’re seeing now. Wars are just not fought like this anymore. And Israel is at a disadvantage because it doesn’t know the tunnel system like Hamas does. Again, brings us back to antisemitism. If Israel is committing war crimes, they will be held accountable. By why is it that Israel must uphold a moral obligation, higher than any other country in the world? Could it be antisemitism? 

We’re so lucky in America to live a relatively peaceful existence. Unfortunately not every region in the world is so lucky. ",04/11/23 20:43:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17nuzkb/our_humanity_is_being_weaponized/,131,647,576,Oct 7,top,all

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB0x58CQk5g  
This is pretty unbelievable, but as a lot of you might already know UNRWA and the UN are deeply compromised organizations that have been infiltrated by Hamas.   
Originally it was through that UNRWA was an organization the aims to help refugees.    
Palestinians have classified themselves as refugees for over 75 years, this is 2nd and 3rd generations of people classifying themselves as refugees.  Obviously a false claim.  A refugee is a direct thing.    
UNRWA has been shown to teach Palestinian children to become martyrs and to want the destruction of Israel and the death of the jews and the west.  Also the U.N. has been shown to be complicit in many of these things.    
We already know that all of the money that has been sent to Palestinians has been taken by Hamas to support their genocidal war effort.    
UNRWA employees have been shown to participate in the Oct 7 attacks.  Our governments need to stop supporting UNRWA and the UN and dismantle these organizations or at the least get rid of the dirt that has infested them.  We need to rid ourselves of prejudice, jew hatred and terrorism in general.  As you can see in these videos a large Hamas base is found in these tunnels directly under the UNRWA headquarters.  Not a base, not an office but HEADQUARTERS!! Yet they claim they didn't know.  Clearly they are lying.  It would be impossible to build or operate anything of this scale without UNRWA knowledge.  The second video shows many of the issues that expose UNRWA for what they really are.  I encourage you to watch both videos and to support the fight against Hamas.

17ftrxl,"Oct 7 was not due to any ""occupation"" or ""open air prison"" or decades of suffering.","Hebron 1929 to October 7,2023 - A Straight Line

The absolute horror of Oct 7 was not due to any ""occupation"" or ""open air prison"" or decades of suffering under Israeli rule.

In 1929, almost 20 years BEFORE the creation of the State of Israel, the Arabs of Hebron rose up and murdered their Jewish neighbors with a blood lust that is eerily similar to what we have seen on Oct 7, 2023.

Here is the account of the events by Raymond Cafferata, the British Police Superintendent was witness:

>On hearing screams in a room, I went up a sort of tunnel passage and saw an Arab in the act of cutting off a child's head with a sword. He had already hit him and was having another cut, but on seeing me he tried to aim the stroke at me, but missed; he was practically on the muzzle of my rifle. I shot him low in the groin. Behind him was a Jewish woman smothered in blood with a man I recognized as a\[n Arab\] police constable named Issa Sheriff from Jaffa. He was standing over the woman with a dagger in his hand. He saw me and bolted into a room close by and tried to shut me out-shouting in Arabic, ""Your Honor, I am a policeman."" ... I got into the room and shot him.

Another notable episode from the massacre:

>When the mob approached the door of Eliezer Dan Slonim, the son of the Rabbi of Hebron, they offered to spare the Sephardi community if he would hand over all the Ashkenazi yeshiva students. He refused, saying ""we are all one people,"" and he was shot dead along with his wife and 4-year-old son.

And also:

>Gershon Ben-Zion, the Beit Hadassah Clinic pharmacist, a cripple who had served both Jews and Arabs for 4 decades, was killed together with his family: his daughter was raped and then murdered.

All this is from the Wikipedia article on the massacre, which I encourage you all to read:

Listed below are examples of how other countries are doing the same thing as Israel while the world stays silent. The following is not an exhaustive list; feel free to add anything that you think I forgot.

*White phosphorus*

Americans use it for [counterterrorism](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/0724_detention_waxman.pdf), here's [Australia](https://www.abf.gov.au/about-us/what-we-do/border-protection/immigration-detention) doing it, and here's [Japan](https://thediplomat.com/2020/09/the-desperation-of-japans-detained-asylum-seekers/) doing it.

*Blockade*

There is [precedent](https://opiniojuris.org/2015/05/11/guest-post-irans-relief-ship-and-the-blockade-of-yemen/) for Israel's blockade of Gaza. Saudi Arabia on Yemen, Georgia on the Abkhazia region, and Indonesia on East Timor have all been considered legal. There are other blockades that are not quite as open and shut, most notably [Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nagorno-karabakh-residents-say-disastrous-blockade-choking-supplies-2023-08-16/).

*Occupation*

To be clear, I don't consider Israel to be occupying Gaza or the West Bank. Did you know that [China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/embrace-communist-rule-china-tells-tibet-at-70th-anniversary-of-invasion) is occupying Tibet and that [Turkey](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/06/turkish-invasion-divided-cyprus-40-years-on-eyewitness-greek-cypriot-family) is occupying Cyprus?

Technically, Israel and the West Bank is a territorial dispute, and there are [plenty of those](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territorial_disputes) throughout the world too.

*Apartheid*

Israel doesn't practice apartheid, but Palestinians are not allowed to own property or have citizenship in almost every Arab country. Various religious minorities do not fare well under Islam.

*Casualties in a war*

This has been discussed ad nauseum on this sub. If we are to take Hamas' 30,000 number to be accurate, almost every other conflict in the ME easily clears this number.  Where were you during the Libya civil war, the Sudanese civil war, or the Syrian civil war?

*Border security/checkpoints*

Yes, every country does this. I get hassled by a not-so-polite Canadian every time I want to go up to British Columbia. China and Russia have 14 countries that they have to do border security with, so you can think about what they do to foreigners. The reasons for border security are pretty universal: human trafficking, identity fraud/theft, drug trafficking, and terrorism.

*Why does everyone else in the world go ignored?*

The I/P conflict is a distraction not just for the ME's problems, but also for various injustices throughout the world. Unfortunately, not everyone values freedom and countries like Israel are actually an anomaly in terms of democracy and human rights.

Ironically, countries with egregious human rights abuses are put in charge of various UN committees who are then able to push resolutions against Israel. Before the 2022 Ukraine invasion, Russia was on the human rights council and such paragons of virtue like Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Libya, and Sudan are currently on the [human rights council](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/hrc/membership).

Arguably, it's safer for the media to report on events in Israel because it actually has a better record on human rights than other countries. It's a lot riskier to report on events in places that don't respect freedom of the press. 

The world also ignores other atrocities throughout the world due to flat out antisemitism. It's just a fact of life that people hate Jews and will always continue to do so, and it's not supposed to make sense. Antisemitism simply exists.  Especially with Muslim countries making up a large bloc of the UN and [China](https://www.jta.org/2023/11/08/global/since-oct-7-antisemitism-has-exploded-online-in-china-heres-why), who currently wields tremendous political influence over pretty much the entire world.

One argument heard from Israel haters is that Israel is a western country, and should be held to a higher standard. However, it would be more fair if the same standard was applied to everybody. Can you imagine if a fraction of the vitriol towards Israel was levied towards Turkey?  The world could probably achieve world peace in two days if everyone was held to the same ridiculous standards that Israel is subject to.",19/02/24 16:42:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1aurshn/a_list_of_stuff_israel_does_that_is_the_same_as/,115,239,657,Oct 7,top,all
18fu49o,Did some math based on recent statistics by the Hamas Ministry of Health and IDF.,"\-As of Dec 10th 18,000 Palestinians were reported killed according to the Hamas MoH and published by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in their recent [flash update](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-65).

\-According to the IDF, [22,000 targets have been struck](https://www.idf.il/160849) and an estimated [7,000 terrorists have been killed](https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-12-11-23/h_0c59cbd1f25e97e88a7a7d2fa34ecaa6) since Oct 7th according to Tzachi Hanegbi Israel's national security advisor.

Assuming these numbers are accurate, we can make the following calculations:

* 61% of casualties are civilians meaning one out of three are combatants.
* The chance of a single Palestinian (both civilians and combatants) being killed per strike is 81.8% which is 5.6 times lower than the global average of 4.5.
* The chance of a single Palestinian civilian being killed per strike is 50% which is 9 times lower than the global average of 4.5.

If we compare the current round of fighting to other recent conflicts around the world:

* The conflict in Gaza is 34.2 times less deadly to civilians than the conflict in Mosul, Iraq in 2017 (17.1 civilian deaths per strike vs 0.5).
* The conflict in Gaza is 43.4 times less deadly to civilians than the conflict in Aleppo, Syria in 2016 (21.7 civilian deaths per strike vs 0.5).
* The conflict in Gaza is 23.9 times less deadly to civilians than the conflict in Raqqa, Syria in 2017 (11.95 civilian deaths per strike vs 0.5).

In conclusion, it is clear to see that not only has Israel's campaign in Gaza been completely blown out of proportion but that Israel is held to impossibly high standards that no other country on earth is held to. Despite having one of (if not the lowest) civilian to combatant casualty ratios it is still somehow not good enough.

Makes you wonder why that might be.

Edit for people wondering where some of the comparison stats are from: https://x.com/elikowaz/status/1734110713780809986?s=46&t=Wt3y7cD8MVdUG-A8McjVwA",11/12/23 13:05:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18fu49o/did_some_math_based_on_recent_statistics_by_the/,114,511,312,Oct 7,top,all
1bv7r7j,Justifying the unjustifiable,"Although I am vehemently against the current conflict, **I acknowledge there are many knowledgeable Pro-Israeli people here who have helped me see some of the nuance of the situation and to help me understand that not every Israeli is a Ben-Gvir**. Recently I felt the conflict had turned a new page and was starting to wind down in terms of civilian deaths and I was very glad.

But then 7 western aid workers were deliberately struck, including one of my fellow Australians - and suddenly my outrage has reignited. Why does Israel continue to do things like this and just isolate itself from world support?

Australia for example, has largely been indifferent to the conflict - citizens seem to care more about housing affordability than the conflict. And yet with the latest strike, you'd be hard pressed to find many Australians who supports the war effort by Israel now. Widespread media coverage. Widespread condemnation. Even the Jewish Council Australia is condemning the IDF.

**We are your allies, and yet you make it so hard for us to support you.**

Why does Israel keep doing this to itself?

Here's a list of questions I just cannot get my head around - please help me understand:

**Targeting Civilians**

1. Why is it when Israel deliberately kills a non-combatant, it's an ""accident"", but when Hamas deliberately kills a non-combatant, it is ""deliberate""? Do you really believe there is no moral equivalency between shooting dead 3 naked, Israeli hostages holding white flags, and shooting residents of a Kibbutz? Especially when each Kibbutz have their own security forces so the line between armed combatant and non combatant is not black and white either. Both are deliberate, unforgiveable and demonic. You are literally comparing a trained IDF soldier to a disenfranchised, untrained, uneducated Terrorist, and yet you excuse the IDF soldier's actions as ""mistakes"" and claim a disenfranchised, untrained, uneducated Terrorist has more accurate target acquisition protocols than a trained IDF soldier. Ergo, **that means either the IDF are as murderous as Hamas, or they are MORE incompetent than Hamas.**
2. If Israel warns people before they bomb anywhere (leaflets, SMS's, roofknockers etc.), even forgetting about the 30,000+ dead, how is it possible that according to the IDF, 10000+ Hamas operatives have been killed. **Are Hamas operatives illiterate to warnings?** Do Hamas operatives just stay in one spot and allow themselves to be bombed?
3. Were leaflets dropped and SMS's sent before the 7 aid workers were bombed 3 times? Were leaflets dropped and SMS's sent to Hind Rajab? Were leaflets dropped and SMS's sent to the Israeli hostages killed by the IDF?

**Claiming the death toll is fictitious.**

4) If you think the Gaza Health Ministry casualty count is incorrect, **how many Gazans do YOU think have died**? Is the number not completely **superfluous** to the point that too many civilians have died? What difference does it make to anyone's opinion if it were 5000 vs 10000 vs 30000 vs 50000? Too many have died. So why go on about the numbers and not believing the Hamas numbers?

5) If you think the Gaza Health Ministry casualty count is incorrect, whose figures do you believe? The figures which have been validated by independent human rights organisations as well as the UN? Or the IDF who cannot even identify 3 naked, white flag waving Israeli hostages correctly?

6) If you think the Gaza Health Ministry casualty count is incorrect, why do you not allow **independent, international journalists** into Gaza?

**Human Shields**

7) Hamas is claimed to use human shields. Hamas is also claimed to hide in tunnels to protect themselves from air strikes whilst civilians are left above ground in the open to die. So if that's the case, **why does Israel keep bombing the human shields,** knowing the Hamas operatives won't be touched?

8) If Hamas is hiding in tunnels, and civilians are left in the open - how is it possible to use someone as a human shield if you are physically underground and your shield is above ground? Wouldn't your human shield just run away?

9) Who were the aid workers human shielding? Who was Hind Rajab human shielding? Who were the two Palestinians shot and bulldozed human shielding? Who were the 3 Israeli hostages human shielding?

**Gazans being at fault**

10) Why do you claim that Palestinians deserve death because they voted in Hamas, despite more than half the population of Gaza not even being alive when Hamas was voted in? Once you factor in that 20 years ago, even those alive back then **would have been children** as well, it's even more damning.

11) Why do you claim that Palestinians are all guilty because they cheered Hamas taking back hostages to Gaza city - how is this any different to the Israelis being all guilty because they cheered warplanes flying overhead into Gaza? How is it different to hundreds of Israelis on Telegram groups **laughing at photos of the dead Australian killed** and claiming she won't be able to **hop with Kangaroos in Sydney** anymore? How is it different to IDF soldiers parading the Bras and lingerie of women they killed?

12) If Gazans deserve the death and destruction they faced because they voted in Hamas, does that mean Oct 7 victims deserved the death and destruction they faced because they **voted in Netanyahu?**

13) You claim **70% of Gazans** support Hamas actions on October 7th. Aside from the fact that 50%+ of Gazans are CHILDREN - if your entire family was bombed, your children buried alive, your spouse blown to pieces, would YOU support violence against the other side? **90%+ of Israelis** are reported to support what the ICJ has concluded is a plausible genocide, so with your own statistics you've basically concluded Gazans are more peaceful than Israelis.

13.5) You claim that Gazans will not be radicalised after this much death and destruction, because German civilians were not radicalised after World War 2. Are you not forgetting this region has been radicalised literally for 80 years? Are you forgetting the most recent war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq? Are you forgetting how ISIS rose up from the ashes? Are you forgetting how Al-Qaeda rose up? Are you forgetting that Hamas itself is literally a product of Israel radicalising Palestine? And you want to make it worse?

**We care about hostages**

14) If you care about hostages so much, **why do you continue to bomb them, restrict aid into Gaza, target their captors** (the only people who have access and know where the hostages are being imprisoned) and jeopardise their lives?

15) If you care about hostages so much, why are **Israeli politicians telling hostage families to shut up**, or threatening them if they dare speak up about the hostage situation? (Source: Israeli news)

16) If you care about hostages so much, why has Israel killed more hostages than they have rescued?

17) If you care about hostages so much, why did Israeli helicopters **fire rockets and missiles at hostage** filled cars driving back to Gaza on october 7th?

18) If you care about hostages so much, why are you so against a Ceasefire, knowing that the last ceasefire r**esulted in the release of 100+ hostages?**

19) If you care about hostages so much, **why are all the hostage families protesting** 24/7 around the Knesset?

**Hamas vs IDF lies**

20) Why do you believe Hamas when they say they want to attack Israel again and again, and yet not believe Hamas when they say they want a ceasefire, or that they did not deliberately target civilians on Oct 7, or that they do not use human shields, or the casualty numbers. I have no reason to believe Hamas, but the fact that you **SELECTIVELY believe Hamas** is just indication of using their words to aid your own agenda. You can't have it both ways. Either believe Hamas, or not. Don't be selective and hypocritical.

21) Why do you believe Hamas when they say they want to attack Israel again and again, indicating their genocidal intent, and yet whenever an Israeli minister says something similar about Gaza you claim ""they do not represent government policy""

22) Why is it that Israel always claim that they will thoroughly investigate an atrocity that Israel has committed - and yet **we never see the results of that investigation**? For example, how is the investigation into the deaths of the 3 naked Israeli hostages shot by the IDF going? Any updates to that?

23) Why is it that Israel always claim that they will thoroughly investigate an atrocity that Israel has committed, and yet no investigation was needed for Oct 7 before air strikes occurred on Oct 8? Clearly it seems like the **IDF could find out the facts about Oct 7 within 24 hours, and yet months after the 3 naked Israeli hostages were shot by the IDF, we still don't know what happened.** Same with Hind Rajab. Same with the other countless victims not publicised by the media.

24) If Hamas lies, **why not allow international media into Gaza?**

18nyhvg,Hamas has said they will never surrender regardless of their own civilian casualties.,"Hamas has said they will never surrender regardless of their own civilian casualties.  Civilian martyrs are  actually part of Hamas’s suicidal defense. We should believe them. 
Israel has some of the same military challenges America faced during WW2. After The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, their military was fighting to the last soldier. Suicidal defense of every island with even greater civilian suicidal defense demonstrated and more expected in the Japanese home islands. No one ever has come up with a “humane” approach to defeating the Japanese empire. Particularly after the atrocities throughout Asia Pacific. The rape of Nanking: 250,000 civilians. Reprisals the Doolittle Raid: 200,000 civilians. Almost 6,000,000 Chinese, Indonesians, Koreans, Filipinos, and Indochinese murdered by the Japanese. Post war analysis and testimony by Japanese military and Civilian government officials indicated the horrific destruction of Japanese was the only way to eradicate the suicidal military leadership and end the war.  My father, along with millions of GIs was on a ship headed for Japan when the atomic bomb was dropped and the war ended.  Neither he or any Allied soldier complained about being rerouted to the USA. Hamas poses the same suicidal military challenge for Israel. IMO Oct 7 was a large suicide attack.  Hamas knew Israel would defend itself more violently than ever before since Hamas committed the worst atrocities against Jews since the Holocaust. Palestinian who cheered the kidnapping of hostages and support attacks on Israel may have not have realized they were going to be Hamas martyrs but they should have known the consequences would be severe. Regardless of what they knew, Israel had to risk civilian casualties when fighting a suicidal enemy. The opportunity for a peaceful solution has passed. It was decided by October 7, by 50 years of rejected peace proposals and Hamas’s murder of any Palestinian who advocated for peace. Hamas has said they will never surrender regardless of their own civilian casualties.  Civilian martyrs are  actually part of Hamas’s suicidal defense. We should believe them.",21/12/23 21:57:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18nyhvg/hamas_has_said_they_will_never_surrender/,111,337,333,Oct 7,top,all
18vah1e,Hamas are parasites.,"The definition of a parasite is an organization that feeds off of the host organism.

1. Hamas sucks up international aid, and instead of distributing it to civilians, they take first dibs, and after their fighters are well fed, and anything that can be used to turn into a weapon is culled from the international aid, then they distribute the leftovers to Gaza civilians.  A few days ago they murdered a boy from a family of co-conspirators because he thought that collaborating with the parasitic organization meant that his family would get first dibs on international aid.
2. A parasite makes the host less healthy. The West Bank, under the PLO has a 19% poverty rate -- too high, but better than Israel's 21% poverty.  Under Hamas rule, the poverty rate WAS 60% before Hamas started a war and made the poverty rate be -- anyone who isn't Hamas is starving. 

Moussa Abu Marzouk, a prominent member of the Hamas political bureau, was asked in an interview why Hamas built over 300 miles of tunnels in the Gaza Strip but has never built bomb shelters for Gazan civilians.   
“We built the tunnels because we are fighting from inside the tunnels,” Abu Marzouk replied. He offered no explanation at all as to why Hamas has not separately constructed bunkers for Gazan civilians below their apartment buildings, schools and workplaces.   
Hamas certainly has the financial resources to protect Gazans. It receives $450 million per year just from taxes and unofficial fees on smuggled goods. But such protective structures would defeat the organization’s purpose. The value to Hamas of a Gazan human shield would be lost if the human shield were given a place to hide.  
In the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, Hamas is counting on human shields and the effect of their deaths on international opinion as their best way to restrain, if not halt, Israeli military force. Hamas considers two million Gazan civilians, including children, as martyrs, whether they want to be or not.   
“We are called a nation of martyrs,” said another top Hamas official, Ghazi Hamad. “And we are proud to sacrifice martyrs.” He promised more attacks: “There will be a second, a third, a fourth.” When asked whether he sought the annihilation of Israel, Hamad matter-of-factly replied, “Yes, of course.”  
This is not simply terrorism, which is the use of illegal violence to achieve political objectives. It is cold-blooded human sacrifice, and on a scale that evokes the ritual slaughters of ancient times.

17btmpr,Eyewitness accounts of the brutality of the Hamas attack,"**UPDATED 12/05/23**

I am appalled by the many pro-Palestinians who deny the Hamas atrocities of 10/7, claiming AI manipulation and propaganda. Despite the fact that Hamas themselves gleefully broadcasted many of their terrible acts. I'm trying to judge these people favorably, maybe they haven't heard the details of what happened. So I have compiled a short list of first hand eyewitness accounts in English published by the media, media reports on footage they witnessed, and archives of public footage, mostly published by Hamas. People who continue to deny that atrocities were committed on 10/7 are probably also Holocaust deniers. Note, Hamas knowingly killed both Israeli and Palestinian victims, as recounted below.

A level of sadism, barbarism and cruelty beyond the worst horror movie.

In this video a young woman in zipties is being led towards Gaza, then the apparent commander says (loosely translated) ""This one is not coming as a hostage, she is a سبية "" - which roughly translates to sex slave/war captive. \[[Video](https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndYomKippurWar/comments/17dr9ep/hamas_deciding_whos_to_be_raped_and_whos_to_be/) with English + Hebrew subtitles\]

**Video interrogations of captured Hamas terrorists:** (Note: It is becoming clear that different cells of terrorists acted differently, in some areas they killed everyone on sight, in others they only tried to take captives, sometimes even treating their captives civilly. It seems that each cell had a specific task, and some cells were much more barbaric than others).

1. (Paraphrasing) ""Our mission was Kfar Aza, we were told to kill everyone, including children, as they are all settlers. Islam does not allow this. We shot at a safe room where there were noises of young children crying, until it went quiet. After seeing the footage you showed me \[of what other Hamas cells did\], we are no different to ISIS. My father doesn't know I'm with Hamas, he would kill me."" [Video interrogation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXs47L4OdwQ)
2. (Paraphrasing, multiple terrorists from different missions are in this video) ""We were told to kill the men, capture the women, children and elderly."" ""Our commander told us to kill as many as possible, civilians, and also capture."" ""We were promised that whoever brings back a hostage gets $10,000 and an apartment."" ""Our mission was to cleanse Kfar Azza, to kill everyone, no hostages. I shot an old lady in the shoulder, she fell. I set 2 houses on fire."" ""They took out a 14/15 year old girl, some said shoot her, others said keep her. He took a selfie with her, and then rode off with her on a motorcycle back to Gaza. There was a body on the floor with 3 bullets in the head, the head had exploded. I shot it again, my friend shouted at me for wasting bullets, we were supposed to continue killing civilians. In another house we blasted the safe room window open and put in a burning rag \[to chase them out\], then we killed the parents and the children and the dog. They were all unarmed."" ""The prophet says ""Do not kill women, do not kill children"", our religion doesn't allow abuse. There is no difference between what we did and ISIS, in terms of the abuse"". ""Hamas tricked us into doing this, they sit in their houses in Qatar and Turkey, speak in the name of Al Aqsa and the Muslims, they stay there and send us here. They let their families in Gaza be bombed. They destroyed Gaza. We destroyed Gaza."" [Video interrogation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5GRHi0K_4)

what I was really hoping is that  after this there would be some sort of restructuring where gazens would get more freedom because of the destruction of Hamas. maybe even more of a peace process after the right wing agenda in israel has been so deeply discredited.

I see gazens keeping on trying to win aginst israel with this baseless fantasy that kills so many of them and an increasingly right wing government in israel killing more and more of them.

18a2d6n,How do pro-Israel people feel when seeing images out of Gaza?,"This question has been on my mind for a while especially as there seems to be less and less “mind changing” with either side. When you see the pictures coming out of Gaza, what do you feel? Are you starting to have doubts and think that Israel’s response may be disproportionate and went too far? Do you believe that all footage is staged or that everyone killed is a terrorist? Do you feel sorry for the civilians killed in a “sorry they’re so brainwashed and chose to align themselves with violence” kind of way? Or are you traumatized by the Oct. 7 attack and the subsequent rise of antisemitism that you find it hard to feel anything toward them at all (which, quite frankly, I understand)?

I’m trying to ask this question a unprovocatively as possible but those are some of the most common pro-Israel responses I see (with the first being by far the least common.)",03/12/23 20:24:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18a2d6n/how_do_proisrael_people_feel_when_seeing_images/,91,1143,157,Oct 7,top,all
18w7cd9,This is not a genocide to the Palestinian people,"The term Genocide is “the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group.” If you look at the amount of Palestinians dead (from Hamas who is untrustworthy) there are sadly 21,000, but if you look at the estimates of Hamas members dead there are around 7,000 a 2:1 ratio. If the Israelis were actually committing genocide to the Palestinians I would expect there to be a bigger ratio. Not only does this show that Israel isn’t just bombing places for the fun of it, it’s bombing with the targeting of Hamas who by the way is a minority in Gaza. For every Hamas member there is 23.6 Gazans, meaning if the Israel were to bomb randomly the ratio would be 23.6:1 instead of 2:1. Yes the argument of Israel bombing schools or churches or hospitals is valid, but it still doesn’t mean Genocide of the Palestinians. Israel’s main goal is to get rid of Hamas, but when that group hides behind these places they show their true colors, Hamas are nothing but Cowards who would rather have its children die for them. This is another reason Israel aren’t sending many troops into the very middle of Gaza. Hamas members could say to a child “hey here’s this Gernade throw it to the those scum the IDF and Allah will save you” or use guerilla warfare. The thing is Israel cares more for its people than these “freedom fighters” Hamas. Israel doesn’t want to send its troops (which most are not voluntarily) into war, while Hamas wants to send all of its people into this conflict knowing this would happen. Realistically after Israel seeing its troops get eradicated with little take over they will go to bombing once more. The only genocide the Israelis are doing is genociding Hamas. I do not think what is happening to Gaza is good, but the people of Gaza BUT MOST IMPORTANT HAMAS is to blame. When 70% of gazans voted for Hamas they aren’t totally innocent when 72% of Gazans said Hamas’s action on Oct. 7 they aren’t totally innocent. Not to mention Hamas is making Gaza what you all think it is. Look at this video before Oct. 7 [video](https://m.youtube.com/shorts/fSk7AYTd1g8?si=83CMCHveLJCU2tCD) it shows beautiful beaches in the society that hardly looks like a “open air prison”. I also hate that argument, since everyone thinks only Israel controls the border of Gaza, but then Egypt is literally sharing a border with Gaza. Yes only people can go through that border but if I thought that Gaza was an open air prison, I would leave all my valuables behind to go to Egypt. Most prisons in the world don’t let you leave at all, so how is Gaza an open air prison? Not to mention the Palestinians are getting so much money Egypt give the Palestinians $500 million, from 2014-2020 Gaza got 4.5 billion dollars from in agencies, Palestine has its own refugee center called UNRWA, Qatar provided 1.3 billion dollars since 2012, 80 million dollars on water projects from European countries, 95.5 million from the US, Israel grantedwork permits to 10,000 Gazans who undergo security vetting, providing a crucial source of income for families with no known connection to Hamas. Hamas had every opportunity to make Gaza a wonderful place yet they used most of that money for terror. You can’t be given 10 billion dollars to your nation and say you are oppressed. You can’t time and time again use violence and say I’m a victim. Sorry if this rant was a bit incoherent.

19a4qep,Thoughts on Bibi “no two state solution”,"
I’ll probably get burned by everyone for this but I like to play with fire I guess…

Netenyahu has recently stated that he is opposed to the establishment of a two state situation after this conflict, given his history, this is about as surprising as hearing “the sun is bright” or “water is wet”

What is surprising is that a time when Israel’s allies are increasingly concerned with the manifold crisis now facing the Palestinian population in Gaza, he would double down on something that is going to be fiercely unpopular.

As someone who has been a staunch supporter of Israel, I think it’s important to note this is not a blank cheque … if Israel were to abandon the two state solution, myself (and you can go into my comment history - I’m ardent and consistent) and many others, will not be able to stand up for Israel.

Those who oppose Israel say the same things: open air prison, apartheid state, oppressed and occupied population… what Bibi is saying now is “you’re right, that’s what we want”. It puts those of us who have supported Israel in an impossible position when we lean into the 1967 borders as the solution, because every other solution proves the cynics right. There is no moral argument we can make to those who support Palestinians if there isn’t a promise of Palestinian statehood somewhere along the way. Bibi is proving every cynic right - he’s feeding the worst of his foes causes and he’s alienating Israel’s supporters.

I will always stand by the Jewish people - but the state of Israel will lose the support it needs to survive if it Bibi gets his way. Not overnight - but he aware: Demographics are changing, young people in Israel’s closest allied states don’t support Israel the same way as older voters - some openly oppose it. Those are our future voters, and old people die every day... (In fact, the idea of Palestinians moving to the west as Bibi once suggested - Canada specifically - is a great way to move our politics against Israel as those people become voters and will be incredibly proactive in anti Israeli propaganda when they get here)

Some people need a reason to believe Israel credibly and believably cares about a peaceful future where Palestinians aren’t an “occupied people”, or they will dig in and we will have nothing to dig them out with.

If status quo continues (or degrades), then in a generation or so, foreign policy will change completely to align with the new demographic realities. Diplomacy will change, the surety of American support could in fact turn into surety of American sanctions, repealing of laws of unyielding support or modification to ensure reduced support… the polls show many young western voters would support that course or action Today.

A two state solution gives Israel a far better chance to go on a charm offensive over the next generation, and give those of us who support Israel, what we need to convince people that Israel is the honest actor - a true democracy - a liberalized society - a civilization that belongs and is part of Our civilizational family and belongs with us. Deserves our respect, and when needed, our cover of protection.

Reading what Bibi was saying sucked the wind out of my sails and ripped them down for a bit… I will continue to fight the hate, support my Jewish brothers and sisters, stand with Israel… but if Israel abandons the two state solution completely, I will become more silent, been proven wrong by every single person I argued with when they told me “it wouldn’t work because Israel would never let it work”. I know the Palestinians rejected peace 7 times, they may reject it 7 more. They will fight again, possibly. My hope is not… 

But We don’t stop fighting for peaceful coexistence. Because the other option is Bellum ad infinitum - endless war - and it will burn the region and part of the world down with it… and No One but the monsters who don’t value human life want that…

Since the tragedy of Oct 7, it had been day after day of tragedy after tragedy. Thousands dead. Thousands more suffering. All this blood is on Hamas hands … but if a real effort for peace doesn’t start, there will be no end. Israel will never be safe, and in a generation or two, it could find itself alone in the world… and That, my friends, is my worst fear from what Bibi has said.",18/01/24 23:48:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/19a4qep/thoughts_on_bibi_no_two_state_solution/,84,545,765,Oct 7,top,all
1b04yom,To the people pro Palestine do you think the brutality of Oct 7 was necessary?,"I've seen so many snuff videos from oct 7 and after that, i have to ask how can it be justified. Even if you want to argue oct 7 was necessary was the actions taken necessary killing men,wemon, children, and animals? burning, maiming, and raping them? Wouldn't a large protest of invasion but not hostile in a populated area to take over government areas be a better form of protest?

&#x200B;

If Putin is a Hamas supporter wouldn't having him aid in a force of arms to enforce a 2 state solution rather then going into a direct barbaric attempt be more logical and humane? Can you honestly say that the actions taken not oct 7 mind you but the actions of that day could not have been avoided? Ive seen many Palestinian propaganda saying how israel should either leave or die; with that how can you say that Palestinians done anything to prove Israel caution is unwarranted?

&#x200B;

why is gaining land a priority so much wouldn't it be smarter to fight for the independence of the West Bank live there and have a 2 state solution? For those who say but Israel done worse so  its okay to. really is that a good argument? why not use go through diplomatic action again putin,china and nk support your side surely threat of war would be more logical then the brutality of oct 7.

&#x200B;

Israel is angry and wants to kill hamas and hamas having trained for a barbaric war for years doesn't prove israels suspicions wrong. with hamas beating civilians for resources and using them as human shields they dont seem to want even what you think they want. with all that I ask wouldn't it be more logical to move to the West Bank and fight for independence than stay in Gaza, especially at this point? where gaza is more or less neutralized.  Again complain about more stolen land but really at this point isnt it more logical to accept a small state like Israel did and demand that borders not be compromised? heck if anything oct 7 made it so a civil agreement is impossible.

As an Israeli, I just dont see the logic in this plan. Many are gonna argue that its because Israel denied for so long to give Palestine its independence since 2006. to that, i ask again why not a coordinated civil movement to get independence then act like the terrorists Israel labeled you as? If invasion was necessary why not instead of massacre use the civilian populous as leverage so israel does not go make extreme measures and with that take over government facilities and have help from your allies to do such?

&#x200B;

Again obviously I do not want any of this im just asking how was oct 7 a good idea? Honestly, a show of force complemented with a little to no bloodshed rule would have been much more effective.

&#x200B;

1azvxbi,Challenge: Name a more cowardly act in recorded history than Hamas since Oct 2023?,"Serious challenge.

Hamas attacks another country murdering 1200 people in grotesque ways mostly farmers and music festival goers.  Takes 200 hostages many children and elderly.

[Link to most comprehensive depiction of Oct 7 events, cited and sourced](https://oct7map.com/)

Tells the world they will do it again and again until all Israelis are dead.

Then goes and hides underneath hospitals, school and homes in Gaza while civilians deal with the consequences of their actions.  Coming up from their tunnels only to shoot rockets into Israel indiscriminately, attracting more danger to the civilians in the area.

[WSJ findings](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/hamas-military-compound-found-beneath-u-n-agency-headquarters-in-gaza-7e29c758)

These are all indisputable facts.  Has there ever been a more cowardly act in recorded history or does Hamas win the award?

I get that they are “freedom fighters” and all, but this approach is more like challenging your neighbour to a cage match to the death, and then bringing your women and children into the cage with you as shields. Each time Hamas shoots a rocket from a civilian area. They put their women in children in danger, and they do it over and over without remorse.

The reasons I see it as the most cowardly, above all others are as follows:

1. They targeted peaceful people mostly for the religion they practice
2. They state much bravado as they see themselves as victorious, but immediately went and stood behind women and children.
3. Many of Hamas leaders will not even venture to live in the horrible mess they created!
4. They claim their people are willing martyrs but it sure doesn't seem like many are willing to the rest of us
5. They fire rockets from civilian areas knowing extremely well that this will result in a military response focused on this area, as any nation defending their people would do.
6. ******They are not only cowardly towards the people they hate, but cowardly towards their own people.  Looking their children in the eye and using them as bullet proof vests.*****

It is one thing to be cowardly against your enemy, another to put your own children in front of you to save yourself.  This is the ultimate act of cowardice. In the dictionary next to coward there should be a man holding his child in front of himself as a shield against a shooter. Hamas has done this millions of times in the last 5 months. Millions. 

**Name a more cowardly act with scale and breadth than this one?**

I ask chatgpt to list the top 10 most cowardly events in recorded history and this is what it gives, I think Hamas wins:

1. Terrorist Attacks on Civilians: The September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States are an example of a widely condemned act where terrorists targeted civilians, causing massive loss of life and suffering.
2. Genocidal Acts: The Holocaust during World War II, where the Nazi regime systematically murdered six million Jews along with millions of others deemed undesirable, is often cited as a deeply cowardly abuse of power.
3. Chemical Warfare: The use of chemical weapons, such as during World War I or the attack on Halabja, Iraq, in 1988 by Saddam Hussein's regime, showed a willingness to cause indiscriminate suffering.
4. Massacres of Civilians: Events like the Rwandan Genocide in 1994, where about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in a span of 100 days, are often cited as acts of extreme cowardice and brutality.
5. Betrayals Leading to Mass Suffering: The forced relocation and massacre of Native American populations in the United States during the 19th century, exemplified by events like the Trail of Tears, are considered acts of betrayal and cowardice.
6. Terrorist Bombings: The Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, where a federal building was attacked causing the deaths of 168 people, including children in a daycare center, is seen as a particularly cowardly act of domestic terrorism.
7. Attacks on Schools: The Peshawar school massacre in 2014, where Taliban gunmen attacked a school in Pakistan, killing 149 people including 132 schoolchildren, is widely viewed as a cowardly act.
8. Assassinations of Peaceful Leaders: The assassination of figures who stood for non-violence, such as Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, or the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, are often considered cowardly because the targets were advocating for peace.
9. Human Shields and Hostage Taking: Using civilians as human shields or taking hostages, as has been done by various groups in conflicts around the world, is seen as a cowardly tactic to deter military responses.
10. Acts of Piracy and Slavery: Historical acts of piracy and the capture and transportation of slaves, such as during the transatlantic slave trade, involved cowardly acts of exploitation and violence against unarmed and often defenseless people.

All of these show acts of cowardice against an enemy, but none show an act so egregious   
against their own people.  The ultimate act of cowardice.  Shielding yourself with your own weak and helpless. ",25/02/24 19:05:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1azvxbi/challenge_name_a_more_cowardly_act_in_recorded/,80,459,830,Oct 7,top,all
19cwk30,"How western media ""covers"" 17 Israelis getting run over by Palestinian terrorists in the streets","Israeli here, sorry for the long article but I am losing my mind here..

I was reading [https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/197841y/a\_minoriymember\_just\_ran\_over\_17\_people\_on\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/197841y/a_minoriymember_just_ran_over_17_people_on_the/) and thought to myself ""I was very sick a week ago and haven't heard of this.. is this true??"" So I went to good ol' google. A quick search for ""רעננה פיגוע דריסה"" which translates to ""Ra'anana car ramming terrorist attack"" and there it was, literally on every Israeli news media.

Picked one at random and noticed a minor inconsistency. This article reported 18 injured and 1 death. Thats 19 people and not 17 like the u/MrRed72 mentions. I thought it would be interesting to find the exact article they saw (it was likely [this one](https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2024-01-15/ty-article/0000018d-0d1c-db13-affd-7d3d324f0000)). I was interested to see how many other inconsistencies there were, and if I think they are intentional or motivated in some way, since as many people in this Reddit keep saying, our media is ""zionist propaganda"" that cannot be trusted.

So here I am, 13:00 PM, combing over articles. I noticed most of them say the woman was murdered, some say she was killed. Some put her name in the title (which made it feel more personal) and some didn't even mention her age, but all of them, true to my original keyword search called it a terrorist attack. I wondered if I can find something that doesnt treat it as a terrorist attack. Searched for ""רעננה דריסה"" instead which translates to ""Ra'anana car ramming"" (we have a word to distinguish intentionally ramming someone with a car and a car accident, not sure what the exact english word for this is). and man.. I couldnt find a single article that did not have the word ""פיגוע"" in the title which translates to ""terrorist attack"". I thought either the Israeli media is super consistent because its reporting an objective easily identifiable truth or because as Reddit keeps telling me, the zionist propaganda is a mastermind at keeping their stories straight.

Here are the articles I've read:

I've compiled all the information from these reports with the low and high estimates for everything that was inconclusive, but from what I can gather:

1. 79 year old Edna Bluestein stabbed in her vehicle, and thrown out to bleed out as perps hijacked her car. She was rushed to the hospital in a critical state and died. It is unclear if she was also run over or only stabbed as it wasn't explicitly mentioned.
2. 4-5 heavily injured people, one of them confirmed to be a teen - age 16.
3. 4-7 of the injured people were children. Unclear if they the teen is included or not. Some reports reported on him separately as he was heavily injured and some reported him as part of the children.
4. 2 of the injured people were french, or had a second french nationality.
5. total 13-19 injured but most likely 17-19. the 13 came from a report that was published less than an hour into the event. my guess is they didnt have all the information at the time.
6. Car ramming happened in 3 separate locations.
7. 3 different cars were used.
8. Perps are Ahmed and Muhammed Zidat, Palestinians from Hebron.
9. one of the perps used 1 car, and the other switched to a 2nd car and continued ramming people after his first one (the one Edna Bluestein was in) was driven into a bus station, then a wall and broke down.
10. the two perps were caught alive.

Either way, it made me curious.. if there are these minor inconsistencies in Israeli media, I wonder how the western media reports it.

Aaaaand now im depressed.

The absolute majority of the articles have WILD inaccuracies, and are painfully blatant in their bias to the point of being malicious. Decided to make a little case study and compare the reports. Below is a critical analysis of each article i've read after googling ""Raanana car attack"":

[https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/15/middleeast/israel-raanana-car-terror-attack-intl/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/15/middleeast/israel-raanana-car-terror-attack-intl/index.html)

1. There is no mention that the perpetrators are Palestinians. It is only assumed.
2. Deliberate misleading terminology:
   1. Not calling the attack an act of terrorism. They refer to it as a ""twin attack"". The only mention of the word terror is when quoting Israeli police and french ministry (two victims were french).
   2. Saying the woman was killed instead of murdered. This is an attempt to downplay the crime. The woman was stabbed while in her vehicle, then thrown aside to bleed to death. The article never mentions stabbing at all, in fact it leads readers to believe she was simply another victim who was run over.
3. Deliberate conflation:
   1. Between settlers and the IDF: ""Israeli settlers or soldiers have killed at least 340 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7"". This is an attempt to misrepresent and inflate settler violence. Most of the deaths are attributed to IDF operations against Hamas militants in WB.
   2. Between Palestinians and Hamas militants and operatives: ""Israeli settlers or soldiers have killed at least 340 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7"". Yes, same quote as above. Most of the deaths are attributed to IDF operations against Hamas militants in WB, not Palestinian civilians like the author implies.
4. Volunteering one sided context: ""Israeli settlers or soldiers have killed at least 340 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said last month that 2023 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the territory since it began keeping records in 2005."" This is an attempt to justify the terror attack as a natural response to the war. It also attempts to paint a picture where Israel is the only aggressor. If they wanted to present a fair picture, they would offer similar context on the other side as well - the Israeli deaths, the continuous ongoing rocket barrages aimed at civilians.
5. Redeeming factor: they did mention there were children injured. Many other news sources simply skip that entirely. Kudos to that.

Conclusion: CNN reporting on this incident is dishonest, borderline malicious.

[https://news.sky.com/story/several-injured-near-tel-aviv-after-car-ramming-and-stabbing-attack-local-media-reports-13048885](https://news.sky.com/story/several-injured-near-tel-aviv-after-car-ramming-and-stabbing-attack-local-media-reports-13048885)

1. There is no mention that the perpetrators are Palestinians. It is only assumed.
2. Wildly outdated information. This isn't justified as the article was posted 5 hours after up to date information was available. Reported 12-13 injured. It was 18 injured + 1 dead.
3. No mention of children injured. Only one teen was mentioned. The rest they referred to generically as ""people"".
4. Redeeming factors:
   1. They did refer to the attack as a terror attack.
   2. They did not volunteer any one sided context. It was a pretty dry reporting.

Conclusion: Sky News is incompetent. This article reads more like a ""breaking news"" piece done before the dust settled, but they still went ahead and posted it.

[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-terrorist-car-ramming-attack-raanana-palestinian-suspect-west-bank/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-terrorist-car-ramming-attack-raanana-palestinian-suspect-west-bank/)

1. Wild inaccuracies:
   1. """"A wounded woman who arrived in a critical condition after having been hit by a vehicle has died of her injuries despite our efforts to save her,"" the hospital said in a statement."" This is straight up a lie. The woman died from stabbing injuries. There is no way the hospital reported it as a result of being hit by a vehicle. This is not supported by any reporting anywhere.
   2. Reported 13 people wounded. It was 18 wounded and 1 death.
2. Deliberate misleading terminology. They refer to the attack as a ""suspected car ramming attack"". The only reference of the word terrorism is in quotes.
3. Deliberate conflation: ""The war sparked by Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on Israel, has left close to 28,000 people dead in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."" They make no attempt to distinguish Hamas militants from the general population. This attempts to present the entire death toll as innocent civilians.
4. Failed to mention amongst the injured were children.
5. Volunteering one sided context:
   1. ""The war sparked by Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on Israel, has left close to 28,000 people dead in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."". No mention of Israeli casualties, the thousands of rockets aimed at civilian population centers. Only the death toll in Gaza.
   2. ""Palestinians in the West Bank often hold protests in solidarity with Gaza's embattled population, and clashes with Israeli security forces, who conduct raids frequently in the occupied territory, have been a regular occurrence since the war began."" Failure to provide fair context on the raids. This attempts to paint a picture where Israel is the sole aggressor that goes and raids innocent Palestinians for no reason.
   3. ""Some hard-line residents of Israeli settlements in the West Bank have been accused of harassing, attacking and stealing the land of Palestinians in the territory over the last 100 days of war. "" This serves no purpose aside from attempting to justify or explain the attack as a ""natural response"". Equivalent context from the Israeli side has been omitted. There have also been many acts of violence from the Palestinian side. Omitting this context again attempts to paint a picture where Israel is the sole aggressor.
6. Redeeming factors:
   1. They did mention the perpetrators were Palestinians.
   2. They did mention the source of the reported death toll in Gaza was from Hamas.

Conclustion: CBSNews is incredibly dishonest and malicious. Over half of the article is dedicated to one sided context that attempts to justify or explain the attack and blame the victims instead of reporting accurately. They are disgraceful.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/15/world/middleeast/israel-raanana-attack.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/15/world/middleeast/israel-raanana-attack.html)

1. Title of the article ""Car-Ramming Attack in Israel Kills 1 and Wounds 17, Officials Say"" says nothing about the attack being an act of terrorism, nor does it even imply it has anything to do with the Israel-palestine conflict. If you only read the title you could have easily dismissed this as an internal affairs issue. I don't think this is intentional or malicious tho, since the very first paragraph does mention the relevant information.
2. No mention of children injured.
3. Redeeming factors:
   1. They provided the name and occupation of the person they were quoting in most places which allows for fact checking.
   2. They did not offer one sided context. They did mention the tensions were high due to the war but they did not offer any specific view point in favor or against either side.

Conclusions: Overall decent reporting. It doesnt have any explicitly biased statements. The only issues I have with them is the omission of the children. I don't know when exactly this article was posted. On one hand they did have a more accurate injured count, and at that point in time they should've known that amongst these injured 5 were children but on the other hand this reads more like a ""breaking news"" article. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

What the hell is wrong with western media? Is journalism straight up dead?.. Does nobody care about truth anymore?..",22/01/24 14:14:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/19cwk30/how_western_media_covers_17_israelis_getting_run/,75,51,1846,Oct 7,top,all
1bn6306,How this started and why I will never trust news from Palestine,"I'll admit I did not have much knowledge about this issue before Oct 7, but after reading several books and watching several documentaries on the issue, I'd like to share some things I've learned. I'm a liberal American and I became very disillusioned with the situation with how quickly the West started to support terrorism. After the rocket fell on the baptist hospital, I realized Western media was mostly driven by clickbait and not facts, so this when I started educating myself.

The first settlers int he 1910 and 1920s realized they would have to live under Arab rule. Once the Mandate was established, that was also the stipulation for Jewish immigration. Britain realized colonies are easier to govern with local rulers that would cooperate with them. I've never seen any honest or real quotes or evidence showing the Zionists had intent to displace or enact violence against local Arabs. Britain made a mistake and appointed a young inexperienced man do be Grand Mufti of Jarusalem.. Haj Amin Al Husseini. He claimed he would be cooperative with British rule. However, he soon instigated massacres against Jews, both native Jews in Jerusalem and settlers. Amin Al Husseini used the Falastin newspaper to spread lies and paranoia about Jews wanted to ""replace"" Arabs, and then lies about the Jews wanting to destroy Al Asqa. This was in 1920. The Jaffa riots and other massacres soon followed. The British upheld Arab and even agreed to bans on Jewish immigration in 1922. Much of the immigration after that was illegal, even if all the land purchases before 1948 were legitimate. The British eventually wanted to arrest Al Husseini for inciting all these massacres. He fled to Iraq and befriended young military men that wanted to overthrow the monarchy there. These men were also in touch with the the Nazis.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K07j-wuL8sw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K07j-wuL8sw)

This led to Amin Al Husseini meeting the nazis and agreeing with their plans for Jews. Amin Al Husseini had clerics loyal to him translate Hitler's book and some speeches into Arabic and spread them across the Arab world. This led to ""copycat"" Holocausts in the 1940s like the Farhud in Iraq. Ironically, Amin Al Husseini caused the exodus of Jews from Arab countries to Israel. in the 1940s.

At this point you might think this is all old history and has nothing to do with modern Palestine, and there is no connection from these actions 100 years ago and today. However, I recently learned a lot.

Yasser Arafat was part of the Al Husseini clan, and Amin Al Husseini was his personal mentor. Yasser Arafat was Amin's cousin. Amin Al Husseini also had direct influence in the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood through Hassan Al-Banna. Yasser Arafat never wanted peace. 

You can also see the legacy of these 1920's extremists in Hamas now. Their military, Al Qassam, is named after a leader of an Arab militia that killed Jews in the 1920s and 30s. Al Qassam was also a close friend of Amin Al Husseini.

The Palestinians have carried on this extreme hatred of Jews for over 100 years. Even the idea of ""stolen land"" and Palestinian nationalism only came about due to Soviet involvement int he 1960s. The Soviets wanted to stop all Western allies and satellites, including Israel. They helped the Palestinians with ways to fool the West.

People also seem to forget the 1993 WTC bombing was carried out by Palestinians.

I realize this is just kind of a ramble, but there is too much for me to list all at once. Everything I have see and read shows me the Palestinians do not want peace. They only want to destroy Israel and kill Jews. They will do anything to fool the West as well.",25/03/24 05:30:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bn6306/how_this_started_and_why_i_will_never_trust_news/,81,104,625,Oct 7,top,all

Disclaimer: I am choosing to solely focus on Hamas here, This post is not meant to Discredit Pro-Palestinians, I'm Pro-Israeli and an Israeli but I will Do my best to provide objective evidence and sources without bias, I Have had several long and in depth and civil conversations on here with Pro-Palestinians and I have found a lot of them to be very reasonable and was able to find common ground with many.  
  
The reason I am making this post is because I've seen a worrying amount of people who are supporting Hamas and are either refusing or unable to see their horrible actions and call it out as such, I'm sure Many Pro-Palestinians and Pro-Israelis will agree that no one should support Hamas regardless on which side they sympathize with more.  
  
Also, Please try to stay on focus in the comments and discuss the issue at hand, Thank you.  
  
  
  
I will Provide a brief Introduction of hamas and how they came to be, Please note that I won't go super in depth because their history is long, But I will provide a Wikipedia page if anyone wants to read the full story.  
  
Hamas Origins:  
Hamas Originally started off as a charity organization in 1973 and was called Mujama Al-Islamiya,  
  
It was created in gaza and was founded by a Man Named Ahmed Yassin who had some connections with the Muslim brotherhood, They provided services such as Clinics ,Blood banks, day care, medical treatment, meals and youth clubs, they also were focused on Islamic education and were recognized by Israel as a legitimate charity in 1979.  
  
  
  
During the First Intifada in 1987 Ahmed Yassin and 6 other Members from the charity founded Hamas and called it the ""Paramillitary wing of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood"", and Yassin became the group's Spiritual leader, Yassin claimed responsibility for several suicide attacks that killed Israelis and continued to advocate for attacks against Israel.  
  
  
  
Yassin was also arrested multiple times by Both Israel and the Palestinian authority, Yassin was killed by Israeli forces in 2004, But Hamas didn't die with him.  
  
  
  
During the 2006 Elections in Gaza Hamas won The elections against Fatah, Hamas won 74 out of the 132 seats, the Two Parties could not reach a deal to share the government several times and were engaged in bloody fighting against each other for control.  
  
This culminated in the Battle of Gaza which took place from the 10th of June 2007 until the 15th of June 2007, Hamas won the battle and took total control of the Gaza strip, Many Fatah officials were Expelled , Executed or Imprisoned soon after.  
  
There has been no elections in the Gaza strip since.  
  
If You would like to read more I linked several Wikipedia articles, I highly suggest reading them and going through the sources provided by them, I also suggest to do your own research on the topic, please understand that this is Obviously not a complete history of Hamas and many key events are missing so please do your own research if you want to know more about the full history of Hamas.

&#x200B;

This Concludes this Portion as well, my last Part will be short and will briefly focus on the Hamas top leadership.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hamas Top leaders are infamous for their insane amount of wealth, Their people are suffering in Gaza yet they enjoy the high life in Qatar with their Billions of dollars and away from the warzone that is Gaza currently, all the meanwhile they continue to fuel their Military wing to keep fighting as they watch on safely from a far far away nation.

Another Small Reminder

&#x200B;

Please try to stay on topic of the subject in the comments, Whataboutism or deflections are not helpful, By all means you can criticize the IDF and Israeli Government, but please do not use that as an excuse to deflect from the purpose of this post.

Finally, My Opinion.

&#x200B;

I think anyone who truly cares about both the well being of Palestinians and Israelis should criticize Hamas and should call out the radicals in the Pro-Palestinian side who are supporting them, some of them even going as far as making the hand glider a symbol of heroism for them.

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, the Pro-Palestinian cause has been hijacked and is being discredited by these people and by their unwavering support for hamas.

&#x200B;

Like I said in the start of the post, I had many many  good discussions with Pro-Palestinians on here, and I respect them for that.

but I also had horrible conversations with people who were actively calling for my death and genocide of my people and the destruction of my country, and being brutally honest about it too.

and the amount of people I had to deal with that will ignore and refuse to acknowledge that oct 7 even happened or try to peddle conspiracy theories with nothing to back them up.

so hopefully this post will make some sort of difference in the overall opinion of Hamas in this subreddit, and then we can move on to actual productive conversation on how we can find peace like I had with many people on here.

&#x200B;

1ah6jnu,How to counter the misinformation about Israel-Hamas war: the guide,"Hey all,

do you get very confused and even angry when you read media coverage and social media posts and can’t tell if what you are looking at can be taken at face value? Although, ultimately, it is quite impossible to always be able to figure out how true what you look at it, there are certain techniques and rules that every journalist (like myself) or researcher (like myself during my time in academia) who work in good faith use to bring the chance of being misinformed down significantly. I organized some techniques in a little guide for those who are interested.

Before you read the rules, I urge you to sit with one question: emotionally, is it more important for you to stay in good grace with your community (Zionists and anti-Zionists on this thread specifically), or is it more important for you to critically think and learn the truth that can make you more confused and uncertain, while simultaneously helping you to be a better person and better serve your community in a long run? Are you more into soothing your fear and anger with information attained in bad faith, or do you wish to build knowledge that will bring nuances and even contradictions into your thinking about the Israel-Hamas war, but will make your thinking more just?

If it’s the former, this post might not be for you. I do not blame people who rally on bigotry or just prefer to ignore things that contradict what they already believe. It is indeed hard, especially if you feel you are being unjustly attacked. I feel for you very much, but you aren’t serious participants of the public discourse who are ready for solutions for yourself or in general.

That being said, here is how I urge you to read the news.

**0.** Don't just skim the coverage, don’t read just one source and definitely don't read just the headlines and assume what you see is truthful. Headers are clickbaits, and very often they leave important nuances out for the sake of bringing traffic.

Example: Russian neoliberal media Meduza published an article on Oct 25 (https://meduza.io/feature/2023/10/25/ya-proshla-cherez-ad) with a header *""I went through hell"": What the Israeli hostage, who was captured by Hamas terrorists, revealed. She was released two weeks after being kidnapped.""*

What we read in the body of the article is the hostage referred to kidnapping itself as hell, which is a horrid act of violence against innocent Israeli civilians, but we also see this quote from the lady’s press conference:

`""They treated us gently, providing everything we needed,"" she said, responding to the question of why she tried to shake hands with the militant right after her release. ""They were very generous to us, very kind. They kept us clean. They took care of every detail. There are many women there; they know about feminine hygiene, and they took care of everything,"" Lifshitz recounted.""`

No matter your opinion, maybe you think this particular woman is just a bonkers old lady with dementia, the “I went through hell” is not ultimately a summary of her reconstruction of what happened to her, it is a part of her experience. Keep your opinions about hamas, but admit this victim's full testimony into your thinking process. Undertones of what we gather about the attack and hostages matter. They do not contradict everything else you might know about the conditions of hostages, they provide you with a fuller picture, and you’ll build on this overtime.

**1.** If it’s a social media post, check the media cited. If none are, and you can't google any serious media outlet covering it, move on, don't use it in your arguments and don't repost, even if emotionally it is very appealing and feeds your beliefs. Yes, many large media conglomerates report in bad faith here and there, but relying on unverifiable information instead isn’t your solution for that. Instead, with a grain of salt, rely on fact-checking websites like Snopes. Although not perfect, Snopes collects links on many instances that can be further studied and does not provide any opinions of their contributors. I wish more serious fact-checkers did more work on Israel-Hamas war, like my favorite Belingcat, but it's not happening fast enough. However, I do highly recommend checking how Belingcat works (it's the only source I trust almost fully because they work with data, not with people) and seeing their scarce investigations.

**Examples:** Jabalia refugee camp bombing Belingcat fact-check. [https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/31/confirming-a-strike-on-jabalia-refugee-camp-as-israeli-forces-approach-gaza-city/](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/31/confirming-a-strike-on-jabalia-refugee-camp-as-israeli-forces-approach-gaza-city/)

Palestinian blooded dolls sold in Israel fact check. [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/palestinian-baby-dolls-israel/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/palestinian-baby-dolls-israel/)

**2.**  If the media looks like a blog, an opinion website, or the whole feed is similar to what you've just seen, move on, these aren’t serious sources of factual knowledge. Additionally, google for any controversies about the media and always check who runs the media.

**Examples:** Both Al Jazeera and The Times of Israel were founded by billionaires (Qatari Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa and Jewish American billionaire and lobbyist Seth Klarman), and you should always keep in mind that even though both of these media report a lot of truthful information, the people who pay salaries have personal agendas. You should always cross-reference from media like this, even if you personally prefer one or another.

3. If it is generally big, respected (by you or by any large group of people) media, see if other big guns posted similar information. If none, keep your doubt.

**Example:** Al Jazeera first published the report of the IDF leaving premature babies in a Palestinian hospital on the beds, who consequently starved to death and started decomposing. In the beginning, Al Jazeera was the only big media source reporting on it, so, while being extremely disturbed by this, I couldn't rely on this information without a doubt. A couple of weeks later, CNN, NBC, Daily Mail, and The Mirror all picked the story up which made it convincing enough for me (and the dread settled in my heart). These media are all run by people with different political agendas (although it's always a Venn diagram) and lean in different directions about the war, so checks out.

**4.** See the sources cited in the article. If there are only regular people, although might be truthful, it is not good enough, unless a lot of people say the same thing. Instead, look for police department involvement, government officials, actual victims, transparent non-profits and their spokespeople, speakers with expertise in the field, and then you can start paying attention. Additionally, hold your horses and give experts time to investigate. Don't feed into public assumptions before that, it's dangerous and it creates further divide that we must be very mindful of.

**Example:** A bomb dropped on Al-Shifa hospital in mid-November that was widely assumed by the pro-Palestinian public to come from Israel almost instantly after the release. However, it would be impossible to say what was actually true before experts went on the ground and assessed. Indeed, later on, it was proven to be a hamas missile misfired.

**5.** If it is a video from a public place with a lot of people, especially at protest, look for more videos. People record them all the time, everywhere, and especially in situations like this. If there's a video of an atrocity from a huge protest, for example, but it's the only one, there's a high chance that the media is altered.

**Example:** ""Gas the Jews"" at the Australian protest that is currently widely used as a prove of vicious antisemitism. There is only one video circulated on that, and it is published by a conservative Jewish group AJA. There are experts who analyzed the video and concluded the sound was altered. On top of that, there are no other videos like that from the said protest. The investigation was conducted by the police (https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/12/13/viral-footage-gas-the-jews-police-factcheckers-unverified/), and it turns out the protests yelled ""f-ck the Jews"", which is still pretty nasty but is not an incitement of genocide.

There are a lot of examples of antisemitic crimes and hate speech that do check out, so to make a valid point about the rise of antisemitism, you don’t need to use false information at all. The facts are there for you. That goes to the rise of Arabophobia as well.

**6.** All that being said, do incorporate real people’s accounts into your judgment and evaluate what you know with them in mind.

**Example:** Instagram page @ eye.on.palestine. The videos dropping there are, without a doubt, horrific. Although this post isn’t for me making my personal stance clear, Zionists, I do urge you to watch them, not to change your views about who is to blame for all of this, but to exercise your empathy muscle towards people who were unlucky to be born in Gaza.

There are three things to say about accounts like eye.on.palestine

*Firstly*, it's just too many accounts of suffering for all of them to be staged. They publish children mourning their siblings, mothers crying in anguish about their killed kids, man carrying unconscious children to hospitals, and doctors performing surgeries under phone flashlights, daily. It is happening, and it is happening to real people with real lives and real bodies.

*Secondly*, you know that already but it’s worth mentioning that hamas officials loooooove Instagram accounts like this and actively rely on them to promote their agenda. However, it doesn't mean everything published on them isn't true and we need to loose sight of the humanity of people we see on these pages. Same for pro-Israeli media. The accounts of released hostages are horrific and we mustn't look away from them, but they do serve people who personally can't give lesser f-cks about the struggles of Israeli hostages.

*Thirdly*, if you can, run some of them by people who might know. For instance, I have a brother, ex-IDF, who lives in Be'er Shiva. I do not live in Israel, and the war is way more real and palpable for him than it is for me. A video of an IDF soldier harassing a teen in the West Bank was dropped by the account and I shared it with my brother (with whom I disagree on many accounts in regards of this s-show, but whom I love and empathize with) and told him ""If I was humiliated like this, or my kids were, I probably would end up building bombs from sticks and s-it myself"". He told me, that sometimes, and more often these days, Palestinian men would send their kids to throw stones at the IDF soldiers, and eventually the army personnel would just have enough and go in for some disciplining. At this point, a person with a camera appears and starts recording, the video is published, and everyone is shocked. I personally believe it doesn't make the IDF look any better, but this isn’t a point made here. The point is his reply gave the nuance I will be mindful of when watching videos like this,  and nuance is more important than ever.

**7.** It's worth saying that all of this will never 100% eliminate the chance the information you believe to be true is actually false. That's why it is important to not rely on anecdotical evidence, including instances from your personal life, to create a full picture of what’s happening in your head.

17rfuuq,Why I'm pro-Israel in this conflict,"1: Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. The IDF dragged Jewish settlers from their houses kicking and screaming. Anyone saying Israel just constantly steals land- you could make an argument for that in the West Bank, but in Gaza, this was a withdrawal from Palestinian land.  

2: The full blockade of Gaza started after Hamas consolidated control of the strip, as a response to thousands of rockets attacks fired indiscriminately at Israeli cities since then. Call it an open-air prison all you want, but Hamas has taken the billions upon billions of aid money and used it to dig up water pipes for rocket assembly, create 500 km of war tunnels, horde all fuel and infrastructure to benefit Hamas, and otherwise treat the people like crap. If Hamas were actually trying to create an independent Palestinian state and not devote al resources to killing Israelis, even a densely populated place like Gaza may have thrived. Everyone demonizes Israel for the blockade but no one has any solution to what to do when an enemy government wants every one of your citizens dead and will stop at nothing to do so, and said enemy government is right next to you and completely dependent on you for basic needs.

3: Had Hamas killed a bunch of soldiers on Oct 7 and taken soldier hostages, I wouldve been extremely angry. But then at least you could potentially make an argument that they were defending themselves, resistance is justified when people are occupied, etc. they went further and decided to slaughter 1000 civilians, home to home, lobbing grenades at families, burning babies alive, shooting children point blank, raping women and defiling corpses. The fact that the left thinks these actions ALSO represent ""decolonization"" and ""resistance"" is beyond the pale. There is no other conflict on Earth, not even WWII when Russians did the same to Germans, where people would cheer for such a thing.  

4: Demanding a cease fire is deeply unreasonable. Hamas said they will do Oct 7 over and over again and will rearm if there's a ceasefire. There are 200+ hostages which include literal babies. A ceasefire is simply supporting Hamas aims.  

5: Everyone is accusing Israel of genocide, but no one can actually provide an actual suggestion for what Israel should do. Hamas deliberately put its bases of operations under hospitals, uses ambulances to get around, attacks in civilian clothing, has their weapons stored in mosques and schools. What is Israel supposed to do? Calling ahead to get civilians to evacuate, creating humanitarian safe zones and escorting civilians to those areas, what more can an army possibly do to protect civilians in the context of battling an enemy like Hamas doing the above in one of the most densely populated places on Earth? What other army in modern history has made such a campaign towards getting civilians out of a battlezone? Russia? US in Iraq? Tigray? Sudan? Yemen? Myanmar? All these places where horrifying atrocities have happened, which army has made those efforts? People keep criticizing Israel but then have nothing to say other than ""Israel needs to do better"" really? All of a sudden everyone who supports Palestine is a military or munitions expert? We also have no clue how many civilians have been killed because Hamas isnt reporting their combatant casualties separately. And when they say children are dead, they're including 16 and 17 year old child soldiers.",09/11/23 15:46:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17rfuuq/why_im_proisrael_in_this_conflict/,75,175,570,Oct 7,top,all
1awarev,It didn't start on Oct. 7,"One of the most common, longest lasting slogans the pro-Palestinians have been using throughout this war, is that it ""didn't start on Oct. 7"", or some variation thereof. This slogan seems to be particularly odd to me. Not just because it's pretty obviously untrue, but because if it *was* true, it wouldn't be a particularly pro-Palestinian argument. I apologize in advance for beating a dead horse here, but since I still see pro-Palestinians repeating this slogan, I feel the need to add my 2c. 

# Why it isn't true

Few wars are fought without a reason. Look at any conflict, and you'll often find decades, if not centuries of grievances behind them. WW2 in Europe is built on grudges from WW1. WW1 started because of imperial expansions into the Balkans in the early 20th century, and the complex geopolitical conflicts of the 19th century. WW2 in Asia starts in the 1930's, and is based on grudges dating back to the First Sino-Japanese war in the 19th century over Korea. The Yugoslav wars and the Chechen wars, the fight between Ukrainian nationalists and Russian imperialists, stretch back centuries into the past. The fact that the war that started on Oct. 7 is the continuation of larger historical conflict is the norm, not the exception.

It's true that not all wars have clear starting points, that lead to occasional debates among historians. But no serious historian recounting the history of this war, would use a starting point other than 6:30 AM on Oct. 7th, 2023. The sheer scale and ferocity of the attack, the sheer surprise of it, after a period of relative calm in Gaza, compared to the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict, let alone the recent Gaza-Israeli conflicts, makes it an unusually clear, obvious starting point. A turning point in Israeli strategic views towards Hamas, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in general, and the clear, declared *casus belli* for the Israeli counter-attack that followed. 

The fact the Palestinians are so proud of both the surprise element, and the ability to inflict a historical amount of damage to Israel, as well as the decade that it took to plan and prepare, make it very hard to argue that this is merely the smooth, indistinguishable continuation of the counter-terrorism activities against non-Hamas groups the West Bank throughout 2023. It's very odd to see pro-Palestinians writing ecstatic posts on Oct. 7, that it's a historical day of liberation and decolonization, only to argue later that it was an unexceptional part of a century old conflict, that the Zionists are unfairly latching onto.

I'd argue that the very fact ""it didn't start on Oct. 7"" exists as a slogan, is evidence that Oct. 7 is in fact a natural, obvious point for the start of this war. Note how there's no equivalent of this meme throughout any of the last Gaza wars, whether started by Israel or the Palestinians. No equivalent in the First or Second Intifada. Even when the exact dates are debated, they didn't particularily matter. Even though everyone understood these conflicts are part of the larger Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the pro-Palestinians didn't felt such a need to belabor that point. This slogan exists precisely because the pro-Palestinians understand that Oct. 7 was clearly a monumental, historical surprise attack, where the Palestinian government of Gaza clearly decided to start this war, that would obviously have disastrous results for the people of Gaza. A very hard problem, for people who'd like to talk about Israeli ""aggression"", and argue the Israelis are just committing a senseless ""genocide"" in Gaza, out of sheer Jew bloodlust and greed.

# Why it's not a pro-Palestinian slogan, even if it was true

But let's say that's the case. If it didn't start on Oct. 7th, when did it start?

Was it in 1948, as the pro-Palestinians like to say, when seven Arab armies launched an unprovoked invasion of Israel, a day after it declared independence?

Maybe it actually started in 1947, when the Palestinians started the civil war that would lead to what they call the ""Nakba""? When the AHC rejected the UN peace plan that the Jews accepted, declared a general strikes, leading to mobs burning down the Mamila center in Jerusalem, sniping at random Jews in Tel Aviv from Jaffa, laying siege to the Jews in Jerusalem... and initially winning, until the Jewish counter-attack?

Maybe it started in 1936, when the Palestinian Arabs started a full-on armed rebellion, to make sure the Jews die in Nazi Europe, rather than being able to flee to Palestine?

Maybe it was in 1920, when the Arabs of Jerusalem, incited by the closest thing the Palestinians would have to a leader, and a future Nazi collaborator, started attacking and ransacking the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem, while chanting ""Palestine is our land, the Jews are our dogs""? Or maybe in 1929, when they graduated to going door-to-door, massacring, raping, looting, and dismembering innocent, non-Zionist Jewish families with axes? All, notably, before any equivalent Jewish violence against them, let alone any oppression, occupation, settlements, blockade, and so on. In fact, those events are the ones who lead to the Zionists to create their militant and terrorist organizations to begin with.

Maybe we should look instead at the uninterrupted history of violence from the people we now call Palestinians, against the people we now call Israelis, from those points to this day. Be it cross-border raids in the 1950's and 1960's. Blood-curdling international terrorist attacks in the 1970's, attacks from Lebanon in the early 1980's, and the first intifada in the late 1980's. Hamas blowing up buses in Tel Aviv throughout the 1990's, to stop the peace process. The entire Palestinian political spectrum joining in, for the massive wave of terror in the 2000's that is the Second Intifada. The tens, if not hundreds of thousands of rockets from Gaza since the Israeli withdrawal, as well as never-ending acts of terror throughout - shooting up cafes and cars, kidnapping and murdering teen hitchhikers, killing Jews praying in a synagogue with axes, and so on and so on.

There's a reason why the pro-Palestinians generally don't usually want you to look at the actual, full history of this conflict. What it reveals, is a consistent Palestinian Arab aggression against the Israeli Jews, for the past century. And while the Jewish violence is almost exclusively a reaction to the Palestinian violence, the Palestinian violence is driven by the same exact motivations both Hamas and their deluded Western supporters openly claim today: opposition to the existence of a Jewish country, on what they view as rightful Arab Muslim land. 

Even though I don't agree ""this war didn't start on Oct. 7"", I completely agree that this context is important. Possibly even more important than the Oct. 7 attacks themselves. But I don't understand why a pro-Palestinian would like anyone else to realize that.

18f1ca5,To those who are saying Palestinian death toll is “not true”,"Here is the report from Reuters on the matter. You’re free to read the entire article if you want. You’ll see that numbers are not just deemed credible by U.N, but by international organizations and universities, and even by Israel. Numbers are of course imperfect and also seem to fall behind the actual estimated death toll recently, since it gets harder and harder to count the deaths as communication and rescue tools are heavily damaged.
https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-have-died-gaza-war-how-will-counting-continue-2023-12-06/

HOW CREDIBLE ARE THE CASUALTY FIGURES TO DATE?

Pre-war Gaza had robust population statistics - from a 2017 census and more recent U.N. surveys - and well-functioning health information systems better than in most Middle East countries, public health experts told Reuters. Oona Campbell, professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said Palestinian health authorities have longstanding credibility with their methods of maintaining baseline statistics and tracking deaths in general, not just during times of war. U.N. agencies rely on them.

""Palestinian data collection capabilities are professional and many ministry staff have been trained in the United States. They work hard to ensure statistical fidelity,"" said Yale University's Raymond.

On Oct. 26 the PA Health Ministry published a 212-page report with the names, ages and ID numbers of 7,028 Palestinians it recorded as dead from air strikes - after U.S. President Joe Biden cast doubt on the casualty figures. Campbell and two other academics analysed the data for a Lancet medical journal report on Nov. 26 and concluded there was no obvious reason to doubt their validity. ""We consider it implausible that these patterns (of mortality rates) would arise from data fabrication,"" the researchers wrote. The PA Health Ministry has not issued a similar detailed report since, a reflection of fading communications with Gaza.

There were questions about casualty figures reported from an Oct. 17 explosion at al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist hospital in Gaza City. Gaza's health ministry said 471 people were killed in the blast, which Palestinians said was caused by an Israeli air strike but which Israel and outside groups including Human Rights Watch said was probably caused by a misfiring Palestinian rocket. An unclassified U.S. intelligence report estimated the death toll ""at the low end of the 100 to 300 spectrum"". But overall, international bodies have attested to the reliability of Palestinian casualty figures.

WHAT DOES ISRAEL SAY?

A senior Israeli official told journalists on Monday that around a third of those killed in Gaza so far were enemy combatants, estimating their number at less than 10,000 but more than 5,000, without detailing how the estimate was reached. The official said the total count of some 15,000 dead as of Monday given by Palestinian authorities, who do not break down the count between civilians and combatants, is ""more or less"" right.

Rights groups and researchers say the high civilian toll arises from heavy weapons used - including so-called ""bunker buster"" bombs aimed at destroying Hamas' strategic tunnel network - and strikes on residential districts where Israel says Hamas has hidden militant bases, rocket launch pads and weaponry within and under apartment blocks and hospitals.

ARE THE PUBLISHED CASUALTY NUMBERS COMPREHENSIVE?

No, experts told Reuters.

""Our monitoring suggests that the numbers provided by the Ministry of Health may be under-reporting as they do not include fatalities who did not reach hospitals or may be lost under the rubble,"" the U.N. human rights office spokesperson said. ""It is a logical assumption that the numbers being reported are underestimated, are low,"" said Nathaniel Raymond, Executive Director of the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health, who has worked on death counts in armed conflict and natural disasters for more than 20 years. The PA's Oct. 26 report said at least 1,000 bodies could not be recovered or brought to morgues, citing families interviewed by its Gaza staff - a clear and plausible example of the impact of war ""on data capture and reporting"", the Lancet article read. The number of bodies feared buried under the rubble now reaches into the thousands and much of the Gaza civil defence force's digging equipment has been destroyed in air strikes, the PA's health minister al-Kaila said on Tuesday.

WHAT'S THE BREAKDOWN OF CHILDREN VERSUS ADULTS KILLED?

The United Nations, as well as Israeli and Palestinian law, define a child as someone under the age of 18, though some Hamas militants are believed to be teenagers. The PA health ministry said on Tuesday about 70% of Gaza's dead were women and children under 18, but it has released no breakdown of age categories since its Oct. 26 report. The Lancet article said the ministry report's data showed that 11.5% of the deaths recorded between Oct. 7-26 were children between ages 0 and 4, 11.5% between ages 5 and 9, 10.7% between 10 and 14 and 9.1% between 15 and 19. ""There was a distinct peak among men aged 30–34 years, possibly reflecting combatant or civilian exposures (e.g., first responders at bomb sites, journalists, and people going out to seek water and food for their families),"" it said.",10/12/23 11:10:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18f1ca5/to_those_who_are_saying_palestinian_death_toll_is/,75,416,844,Oct 7,top,all

&#x200B;

p.s: no one justifying the death of innocent people men, women, and children. For the 7 billionth time. Hamas uses women and children as shields hiding in densely populated areas and putting their bases underneath things like schools, hospitals, and other places. They disguise themselves in ambulances and other trucks as well. Their leader tells people to stay in these areas as human shields. If Hamas is not exterminated they will come back to Israel. IDF does not bomb these places to kill citizens. hamas makes the space so personal that it would be suicide to attempt to go at them in a small range and would cause casualties regardless. israel tries to do everything it can but has to eliminate Hamas to prevent Oct 7. In war morality takes a back seat to survival. Most of Gaza supports Hamas and trusts them too. yes, there are those forced in but also volunteers.

17fy4kq,Social media is fucking broken,"The echo chamber of social media is the worst I’ve ever seen, and it’s causing mass denial specifically towards what happened in southern Israel. I follow a few different Israelis & Palestinian peace activists on Instagram, and ALL of them have been expressing absolute devastation at the Oct 7 massacre AND the horror of thousands of civilians being killed by airstrikes in Gaza. They all want the violence to end and a just future for all. You know, like normal people with a moral compass.

  
But in the west I have seen so many public figures outright deny that Oct 7 even happened, and that it was either made up completely or not so bad. There are specifically two American public figures — Amanda Seales & Shaun King — that have shared Pro-Hamas videos (yes, pro-Hamas) trying to persuade their millions of followers that it’s “Israeli” or “Zionist” brainwashing to believe Hamas have done anything wrong. Zero coverage of what happened on Oct 7. I’m not exaggerating, they both shared bits of footage of that lady released, Yocheved Lifshitz, trying to show only the “positive” parts — like when she shook the terrorists hands and said “Peace” to him, or when she said she was treated “well” in her captivity in the tunnels. What they are intentionally missing out is:

  
– the fact that this woman is a literal Israeli peace activist who has years of experience interacting with her Gazan “enemy”

  
– the rest of the footage saying she “went though hell”, and about being beaten with sticks during her abduction and having her belongings stolen off her, and that she was only had her needs met once she was in the tunnel under guard

  
– that her husband is still a hostage and she has to keep his safety in mind

  
– that her shaking the terrorists hand is revealing of her peaceful and clearly gracious character, and gratefulness to be released unlike 200+ others, not evidence that Hamas was actually gOoD tHiS wHoLe TiMe

  
– that for Hamas there is zero benefit to their bargaining to have continually harmed or dead hostages, so of course they’re obligated to “treat them well”. They also stated when they released the American mother and daughter first that they wanted to show they were “humanitarian”, because they know their public image has further been harmed by the go-pro footage their militants released of them slaughtering civilians.

  
Shaun King & Amanda Seales also are pinning or liking comments that support the false narrative that Hamas are simply “mischaracterised” by Israel and are actually good. I have screenshots of it all but not able to share on this post. Countless people are literally commenting “she would rather stay in Gaza”… when she was abducted as a HOSTAGE and has spent weeks in a tunnel with Islamist terrorists against her will, under mass Israeli bombing. Shaun King doesn’t surprise me much — he’s a trauma profiteer and con man. I don’t think he actually helped so-called “confidentially” release the American hostages like he desperately wanted to take credit for, but if he did have any involvement it means that he has contacts directly in Hamas. Shouldn’t he be under investigation if so?

  
Amanda Seales was more of a surprise — she even outright denied the women survivors testimonies of rape in response to someone pointing it out and I quote “That is NOT true. Stop spreading disinformation. You are insulting ACTUAL victims and those of who have actually been victims of SA in a blind support of an abundantly fallible govt”. There’s footage of it, including released video evidence of blood between several women’s legs or staining their pants in the aftermath. In any other scenario she would be hugely called out for protecting the abuser, but because she stamps it simply as “Israeli propaganda”, people just shrug?! The dehumanisation & delusion is wild.

&#x200B;

  
How have these people, with such huge platforms, hijacked the genuine Palestinian movement with this pro-Hamas bullshit?

1bvwraj,"Iran's Plan: Bring Down The Jordanian Regime, Attack Israel On All Fronts, Undermine Gulf States","Jordan was already walking a [tightrope](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/jordan-gaza-protests-israel-abdullah-economy/) before the Gaza war. By autumn 2023, Jordan had been facing economic turmoil: unemployment rose to 22%, and polls were showing that 63% of Jordanian were considering emigrating, ""a higher percentage than nearly insolvent Lebanon and conflict-ridden Iraq"". According to the [Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/4084029-jordan-will-likely-be-irans-next-domino/), the Jordanian regime is perpetually on the brink of economic collapse, surviving ""just barely, year after year, thanks only to favorable trade deals with Israel and aid from the West and the Gulf.""

The woes have risen since the Gaza War began. Up to 60% of the Jordanians are of Palestinian origin, and most have voiced strong opposition to Israel's campaign in Gaza and Jordan's perceived complicity. 66% of Jordanians supported the Oct 7 attacks, breaking out in protests during which at least a thousand people were arrested by the Jordanian security forces. On the economic front, the Jordanian tourism-driven economy has taken a hit too.

In recent days, Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood has mounted [incitements](https://www.memri.org/reports/jordanian-regime-furious-hamas-muslim-brotherhood-they-are-acting-foment-chaos-kingdom) to take direct actions against Israel. More threateningly, a Hezbollah spokesperson in Iraq said on April 1 that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which is a coalition of Iranian-backed militias, has prepared to “equip” 12,000 “Islamic Resistance in Jordan” fighters with a significant supply of weapons. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) [states](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-april-2-2024) that, although the statement is ""likely aspirational given the current strength of the Jordanian armed forces"", it ""indicates a growing Iranian interest in using Jordan in its anti-Israel campaign."" 

Recent domestic unrest and large sustained demonstrations in Jordan against the Jordanian government’s Israel policy may be driving Iran and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq to approach Jordanian infiltration differently and more overtly. Thousands of Jordanians have demonstrated in front of the Israeli embassy in Amman since March 24. Protestors have repeatedly clashed with Jordanian security services, and the government has accused groups of stirring up ”strife.” 

Understandably, this has raised security concerns for Arab Gulf states, for fear that their regimes could be next. The Saudi media has mobilised in support of Jordan. For example, on April 2, Al-Jazeera has recently published an article, translated by [MEMRI](https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-grand-plan-bring-down-jordanian-regime-attack-israel-east-and-thwart-western-sunni#_ednref9), stating that ""The Saudi leadership, government, and people will not hesitate to stand alongside Jordan, as long as the developments in the situation demand it. This is because they [the Saudis] see Jordan's stability and security as integral to the stability and security of Saudi Arabia."" Similarly, on April 2 the Palestinian Authority has [reiterated](https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-grand-plan-bring-down-jordanian-regime-attack-israel-east-and-thwart-western-sunni#_edn10), that it opposes ""all the attempts to harm [Jordan's] security and stability or to use the suffering of the Palestinian people in the [Gaza] Strip to harm the Jordanian arena, [and their opposition also to] any external [i.e. Iranian] interference in Jordan's internal affairs."".

According to [ISW](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-april-2-2024) and [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/4084029-jordan-will-likely-be-irans-next-domino/), ""if Iran manages to bring down the Jordanian regime, as it has others, then Israel’s destruction might suddenly become a far more realistic, near term prospect."" An active and well-armed Iranian-backed militia based out of Jordan would dramatically advance Iran’s military encirclement of Israel. An expanding Axis of Resistance network in Jordan would also facilitate Iranian efforts in the West Bank. Jordanian territory also offers multiple ground routes through which Iran could move military materiel into the West Bank.

On a regional scale, ""if Iran seizes control of Jordan through proxies, or undermines the government enough to replace the Hashemite leadership, it would [seriously weaken](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4404338-jordan-is-at-risk-of-falling-into-iranian-hands/) American and regional security. Approximately 3,000 American troops and the Muwaffaq Salti Air Base — a launch pad for counter-ISIS operations — would be threatened. U.S. military intelligence capacities in the region would suffer.""

Obviously, the fall of the Hashemites would also be catastrophic for the Palestinians too. A destabilised Jordan, involved in a multi-front war against Israel, likely with participation from the West Bankers, would enable Israel, now facing a veritable existential threat, to expel the Palestinians across the River Jordan. 

Ever since 1979, Iran's Ayatollahs have [proclaimed](https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-grand-plan-bring-down-jordanian-regime-attack-israel-east-and-thwart-western-sunni#_edn10) that the Iranian revolution is the starting point of a ""comprehensive Islamic Revolution"" that would be achieved by exporting unrest. Iran’s victories in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen have shown that the danger is very real. Yet, according to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4404338-jordan-is-at-risk-of-falling-into-iranian-hands/), the U.S. seems largely paralysed in fear of sparkling the situation out of control. In conclusion, ""without American support to weaken Iranian influence, the Shia crescent threatens to pull down a key American ally in the Arab world, which would be devastating to the entire region.""",04/04/24 19:45:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bvwraj/irans_plan_bring_down_the_jordanian_regime_attack/,71,161,743,Oct 7,top,all

Iranians are celebrating the killings of 7 IRGC commanders in Damascus (She said it with a smile). I really want to know what these 7 high ranking Islamic Revolutionary guards were doing in Syria ? (Islamic Revolutionary guards are not diplomats). Of course they were planning for another Oct 7th terror attack.

Millions of Iranians celeberate the killings of these IRGC, because these are the IRGC officials which brought sorrow, sadness and misery to the people of Iran and to the people in the region as well. Iranians were cheering, drinking, celeberating the killing of these warmongers. 

People of Iran never never want war, but they are happy when they see that those who created war, those who started war now getting killed in the chaos that they are responsible for creating in the region. 

The Iranian people said they lied to us when the Islamic Republic of Iran said that our enemy is the American government. Our enemy is Israel. Our enemy is right here, the Islamic Republic regime. Islamic Revolutionary guards are responsible for killing Iranian people, blinding Iranian people for peacefully expressing themselves, raping Iranian girls and Iranian women for the crime just walking unveil in public, just showing their hair. 

Islamic Republic regime killed alot of Iranian people. 

Wrongly lobbyist outside Iran try to potray Qasem Soleimani (assassinated by the US) and Islamic Revolutionary guards as heroes. But they are the warmongers, terrorists, that is why the Iranian people asking the democratic countries to designate the Islamic Revolutionary guards as a terrorist organization.


QUESTION 1 : Do you think there can ever be peace in this region with the Ayatollah still in power in Iran, funding Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and many other terrorist organizations, sponsoring terror, masterminding attacks against Israel and destablising this region ? 

QUESTION 2: How is there going to be any future two-states solution to this Israeli-Palestinian conflict that many world governments talk about, if the Ayatollah continues to give millions and billions to arm Hezbollah, Houthis, etc… even if Hamas were to be eliminated, Hezbollah, Houthis, etc…. will continue their terror attacks against Israel.

1aql1e7,Debunking the pro-Palestinian narrative (but more directly this time).,"I've been wanting to write a detailed post on this subject for a while but had difficulty finding data that would not be immediately rejected by pro-Palestinians. Thankfully, UNRWA itself has done me a huge favor and started publishing a [very detailed report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTVkYmEwNmMtZWYxNy00ODhlLWI2ZjctNjIzMzQ5OGQxNzY5IiwidCI6IjI2MmY2YTQxLTIwZTktNDE0MC04ZDNlLWZkZjVlZWNiNDE1NyIsImMiOjl9&pageName=ReportSection3306863add46319dc574) regarding the distribution of aid in the Gaza Strip.

The first section of the dataset shows the number of days the crossings into Gaza have been open, the number of trucks that have passed through them, as well as their contents.

According to the datasheet, the crossings have been open a total of 152 days since the data started being recorded on Oct 21st. In other words, between the dates of Oct 21st 2023 and March 26th 2024 (yesterday) the crossings were only closed for a total of 5 days.

In total, 17,599 trucks entered Gaza during that period. 9,231 of them from the Rafah crossing and 8,368 of them through the Kerem Shalom crossing:

>\-11,771 or 66.8% were food items (food and water).  
>  
>\-3,531 or 20% were non food items.  
>  
>\-1,094 or 6.2% were medical supplies.  
>  
>\-908 or 5.1% were mixed items (food, water, and non-food items).  
>  
>\-294 or 1.6% were uncategorized.

[According to the UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142622), each truck carries approximately 20 tons:

>""To gauge the volume, a convoy of five trucks is carrying, among other things,100 tonnes of food parcels. That’s about 20 tonnes of food per truck. Other vehicles contain additional donations of ready-to-eat food that continue to arrive.""

If 11,771 trucks hold 20 tons, a grand total of 235,420 tons (213,569,431.4 kg or 519,012,257.6lb) of food items have entered Gaza since Oct 21st.

Divided by 152 this comes out to 1,405,062kg or 3,414,554.3lb of food items per day.

With a population of 2,375,259 in Gaza this comes out to 0.59kg or 1.43lb of food items per person per day.

As we scroll further down the datasheet we can find a section that details the cargo of each truck that enters Gaza as well as its date of entry, donation source, and which crossing it used. Unfortunately UNRWA does not separate food and water in the food item category or food, water, and other items in the mixed items category. As such, the calculation of food items per day is not exact and may be either higher or lower depending on the exact contents of each truck. Despite this we will assume my calculation of 0.59kg/1.43lb per day to be accurate for the sake of argument.

According to an [article](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/calorie-counting-made-easy) published by Harvard Medical School (although many other sources exist), men need approximately 1,800 calories per day while women need 1,200 to maintain their weight.

As we can see after parsing the data not only is there enough food entering Gaza to provide food for everyone each day, but there is an excess of food per person.

I have not used a single pro-Israel source in my post and all the data is directly from UNRWA. My three additional references were from UN News, Harvard (which is hardly considered to be pro-Israel), and a nutrition calculation site which would be classified as unbiased.

[Video 1](https://www.memri.org/tv/displaced-gaza-residents-hold-anti-hamas-rallies-hold-posters-calling-release-israeli-hostages) 

The young people called on the terrorist organization to release the Israeli hostages and end the war. In front of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, the children held up white pieces of paper with the inscriptions ""Yes to the return of the hostages"" and ""The people want to end the war"" and expressed their wish to return to their homes to return to the northern Gaza Strip.

The demonstrators shouted slogans like “The people want to end the war! We put our trust in Allah, he is our best supporter! We don't want food vouchers! We want to live!” One woman complained about having to live in tents. »We're drowning. We are dying. We want to go back to our houses! Stop it! Stop it! Someone should take care of us. The people are the victims.«

While Hamas is simply sleeping and knows nothing about the concerns of the people of Gaza, the war is affecting precisely these ordinary people, the woman explained, while the demonstrators said, ""We want to go back home, to Beit Lahia!"" We want to go back home to Al-Shati! We want to go back home to Jabalia! Leave us alone!” shouted.

The protest came a day after another small demonstration against Hamas in the southern Gaza town of Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Videos circulating on social media showed Palestinians cursing Hamas and its leader Yahya Sinwar, who is responsible for the Oct. 7 massacre of Israelis near the Gaza border, leading to the war.

And a day later there were further protests on Thursday. Footage posted on social media shows a large crowd of Palestinians demonstrating in the streets of Khan Younis, calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to end the war in Gaza. «The people want a ceasefire! Netanyahu and Sinwar, we want a ceasefire. Enough with the war and enough with the destruction,” they chant.

While calls for ceasefire directed at Israel are common, calls from Palestinians in Gaza directed at Sinwar are far rarer. While in yesterday's clip it was mainly women and children protesting, in today's clip it was mainly men - a possible sign that discontent is growing.

»Apart from individual Palestinians in Gaza who have already raised their voices publicly from time to time against the Hamas government in the enclave, these are - as far as is known - the first protests criticizing Hamas since the outbreak of the war on October 7th “Demand an end to the conflict,” wrote the Jüdische Allgemeine about the demonstrations that have taken place in the past few days.



I would like to point out that I have claimed several times in the comments that the last major protests against Hamas were the ""We want to Live"" protests in 2019.
This turns out to be outdated.
The last large demonstration took place in  Gaza over several days on July 30, 2023.

I would like to apologize for this incorrect information.

17r2c8q,Mainstream Outlets Had Photographers Embedded With Hamas As Terror Attack Unfolded: Report,"Photographers from the Associated Press and Reuters appear to have been embedded with Hamas terrorists as they executed terrorist attacks against Israel on October 7, according to a new report from Honest Reporting, a media watchdog.
Photos posted by the news agencies of the surprise terrorist attack on Israel include ones showing terrorists breaking the gates to Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where residents were caught completely off guard and dozens were murdered. Photos also show that photographers were on the scene as terrorists took civilians such as Shani Louk hostage, and attacking Israeli tanks on the other side of the Gaza border.

The photos raise serious questions about whether the news agencies had advance knowledge that the terrorist attacks were taking place. The four individuals credited by the Associated Press for images of the attacks — Hassan Eslaiah, Yousef Masoud, Ali Mahmud, and Hatem Ali — are all photographers based in Gaza, where it was revealed in 2021 that the Associated Press shared office space with the terrorist group.
One of the photographers, Hassan Eslaiah, has reportedly been pictured getting kissed by a top Hamas operative who is said to be one of the chief architects of the deadly terrorist attacks, which killed over 1,400 and have led to a massive war with Israel.

Eslaiah’s social media posts from the day, which have since been deleted but were preserved by Honest Reporting, show he was on the scene. “Live from inside the Gaza Strip settlements,” he wrote along with an image of himself with a burning Israeli tank.

After publication of this article, a spokeswoman for the Associated Press denied any advance knowledge of the attack.

“The Associated Press had no knowledge of the Oct. 7 attacks before they happened,” said Nicole Meir. “The role of the AP is to gather information on breaking news events around the world, wherever they happen, even when those events are horrific and cause mass casualties. AP uses images taken by freelancers around the world, including in Gaza.”
Reuters did not respond to a request for comment. The New York Times and CNN, which both have worked with the photographers in question, also did not respond to inquiries.",09/11/23 02:09:12,https://www.dailywire.com/news/mainstream-outlets-had-photographers-embedded-with-hamas-as-terror-attack-unfolded-report,64,32,363,Oct 7,top,all

In fact, **a 2020 study showed that 53·5% of Gazan children had PTSD even before this conflict**. 2 Such conditions often go untreated due to a lack of awareness from health professionals, a shortage of mental health professionals, and Israeli restrictions on foreign aid.

Since Oct 7th, the amount of [PTSD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967) on both sides must have skyrocketed.

Regarding the U.N. Resolutions, the GA has always been heavily against Israel, because of the Arab voting block. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/17jcuwa/comment/k71ixpt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is a good overview:

> Because Arab lobbying bloc. It is a guaranteed ~100 votes from the OIC nations and poor African states, as well as a few key abstentions from East Asia for almost every resolution. The Arabs can pretty much strongarm anything through the UNGA. [...] This is why Israel realized as early as the 1960s, that it was no use reacting to every UNGA resolution. Abba Eban, one of Israel's biggest diplomatic figures, quipped:""If Algeria introduced a resolution declaring that the earth was flat and that Israel had flattened it, it would pass by a vote of 164 to 13 with 26 abstentions.""

Remember that the [UN GA Resolution 3379](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379), declaring Zionism itself ""a form of racism and racial discrimination"", was in effect between 1975-91. The international support for Israel has risen significantly since then.

Even the Arab world has sticked by the Abraham accords, all the while condemning Israel in words. For example, the Chairmen of Foreign Affairs Committee at the UAE Federal National Council [said today](https://ejpress.org/are-the-abraham-accords-stronger-thant-the-war-between-israel-and-hamas/) that ""The [Abraham] Accords are our future"" and ""We want everyone to acknowledge and accept that Israel is there to exist"".

188l51o,Analysis: There are claims that the civilian to combatant ratio in Gaza is 100:1 - is this true?,"**(UPDATED 12/4 with new numbers)**

In the ""debate"" (shouting match) between Rabbi Shmuely Boteach and Mohammed Hijab on Piers Morgan's show 2 weeks ago, one of Mohammed's central claims was that there are 100 civilians killed for every 1 combatant, at that rate Israel will have to kill 3 million people to reach their goal of killing 30,000 Hamas fighters. He said this was based on the IDF's own reporting of dozens of Hamas killed to date, as quoted by the Guardian - to be generous he will place that number at 60 fighters - vs 10,000 Gazans killed. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jsJYHuGPms&t=1065s)

Two big problems with his claim:

1. His own maths is off, 10,000/60=166, so 165:1, not 100:1
2. He can't even properly comprehend the meaning of the **title** of the Guardian article he is quoting: [Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have killed dozens of Hamas commanders, says IDF](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/08/israeli-airstrikes-on-gaza-have-killed-dozens-of-hamas-commanders-says-idf). Since when do numbers of commanders killed = total numbers of combatants killed?

**So, what is the actual civilian:combatant ratio?**

If we take at **face value** the latest numbers from Hamas ([15,000 dead and thousands more under the rubble](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-negotiators-try-get-israel-hamas-agree-extend-truce-again-2023-12-01/#:~:text=Israel's%20assault%20has%20laid%20waste,and%20feared%20buried%20under%20rubble.)) and the latest IDF numbers of combatants killed (somewhere in the middle of 1-10k - [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/81717934-e941-4064-9371-30c517399879) | Between 5-6k, with the most exact number given being **5,300** - [Ynet](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/yokra13696477)\- ^(this number is of confirmed combatants killed as calculated during the period of the ceasefire, including those killed in Israel in the first few days, and places the total Gaza death toll, according to Israeli intel sources, at 15,000 with thousands more missing in the rubble and tunnels -  in line with the Hamas figures, but a much higher ratio of fighting age people)), **the ratio is** ^((assuming that the ratio of those under the rubble and in the tunnels is the same as the confirmed deaths ((15,000-5,300=9,700/5,300=))) **1.83:1**, or about 65% civilians vs 35% combatants.

**How does this compare to other conflicts?**

[According to UN published estimates](https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14904.doc.htm), urban conflict tends to have a civilian:combatant ratio of 9:1 - as in 90% civilians.

**2014 Gaza war**, IDF claims 1:1, critics say 3:1

**US drone strikes in Pakistan**, they say 1:5, critics say 10:1

**Iraq war**, estimates vary between 1:2 to 3:1

**NATO in Yugoslavia**, they claim 1:10, critics say between 4:1 to 10:1

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualty_ratio)

**Caveats to taking the numbers at face value:**

**Palestinian death toll:** As is well reported, the numbers are essentially provided by Hamas. Though most news outlets point out that, historically, the Hamas provided death toll has proven to be accurate, what they don't point out is the vast differences in how Hamas is reporting the death toll in this conflict compared to others.

1. In the past, they have provided a number of combatants killed, which has been noticeably absent this time around.
2. Hamas publicly made claims of a mass-casualty strike (Al Ahli hospital) and provided a huge number of deaths within minutes - 500. Although that number was revised down to 471, it is not even close to [the assessments of outside intel agencies](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67347201#:~:text=However%2C%20one%20discrepancy,of%20civilian%20casualties.%22) \- even the amount of humans that can physically fit in the small area of the blast [doesn't compute](https://twitter.com/Nrg8000/status/1714552327431135242). This is a clear indication that something is off with the numbers this time.
3. As the Al Ahli hospital incident highlighted, Hamas will count all deaths, even those caused by Gazan rockets, as being caused by Israel. Considering that [Israel has put the percentage of rockets that fell short this conflict at 12%](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-fires-rockets-deep-into-israel-setting-off-sirens-tel-aviv-2023-11-10/#:~:text=Some%2012%25%20of%20Gaza%20rockets,of%20launches%2C%22%20it%20said.&text=Our%20Standards%3A%20The%20Thomson%20Reuters%20Trust%20Principles.) (of [11,500](https://www.jns.org/more-than-11500-rockets-launched-at-israel-since-oct-7/) - that's about 1,400) - there is a very real possibility that a significant percentage of the alleged Gazan death toll was caused by Gazan rockets. Even just Al Ahli is (471 out of 15,000 =) 3.14%. In past instances that human rights orgs have confirmed Gazan fatalities caused by rockets (with smaller rockets than what is suspected in Al Ahli), the deaths toll has been in the 5-15 range for each rocket. [HRW 2021 7 dead, 2 children](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/08/12/palestinian-rockets-may-killed-civilians-israel-gaza) | [Amnesty 2014 13 dead, 11 children](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/03/palestinian-armed-groups-killed-civilians-on-both-sides-in-2014-gaza-conflict/)

**Combatant death toll:** As Hamas is not providing any numbers, we can only go based off of Israel - they too have only provided rough estimates. As [Eylon Levy put it](https://youtu.be/NpFbD0eTrB4?si=qR4Q5ESCDp3RLxpy&t=623), no country in the history of warfare has been able to, or been expected to, give a running tally of enemy combatants killed while still in the fog of war.

**A Sobering Thought:** If Israel does indeed need to kill every last Hamas fighter, which are estimated to be between 30-40 thousand - say 35 thousand, at the current guesstimated ratio, we could be looking at a death toll of (2.83 x 35,000 = 99,050) about 100,000. No major war has ever been won with a low death toll. The human suffering will be great. Let us hope that Hamas will be defeated before we ever get close to that.

187yig6,Is it possible that Netanyahu anticipated the attack and let it happen?,"The New York Times is reporting that Israel was aware of detailed plans for what happened on 10/7:

“Israeli officials obtained Hamas’s battle plan for the Oct. 7 terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, documents, emails and interviews show. But Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, considering it too difficult for Hamas to carry out.

The approximately 40-page document, which the Israeli authorities code-named “Jericho Wall,” outlined, point by point, exactly the kind of devastating invasion that led to the deaths of about 1,200 people.

The translated document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, did not set a date for the attack, but described a methodical assault designed to overwhelm the fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and storm key military bases, including a division headquarters.

Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision. The document called for a barrage of rockets at the outset of the attack, drones to knock out the security cameras and automated machine guns along the border, and gunmen to pour into Israel en masse in paragliders, on motorcycles and on foot — all of which happened on Oct. 7.”

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare 

Now it’s possible that Netanyahu is simply the most incompetent leader of any nation in history, but this revelation suggests that everything on 10/7 and after could have been avoided, and was in fact a planned operation known in detail. 

I’m still reeling. I never imagined that Israel had this level of knowledge. It’s certainly not unreasonable to believe that the Israeli political leadership was willing to sacrifice thousands of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives, in support of their nationalist agenda.

1byr873,Controversial Post on a Saudi Sub About Prospect of Peace with Israel,"So I published this controversial post (translated from Arabic) on a Saudi Sub (I am Saudi) about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict:

-_-_-_-

This post will be annoying for many. But I promise you my aim is NOT provocation. If you lack the capacity to accept differences in opinions, I advise you to stop reading.

Every time I publish a post on this sub (r/SaudiforSaudis) on any subject unrelated to the Palestinian issue, I get DMs and comments accusing me of treason and dishonesty due to my current views being pro-peace. And I say, ""my current views"" because my loyalty is only to the truth. So my views change depending on the latest data. 

To arrive at my current views, I spoke to Israelis, to Palestinians (especially my stepmom), to axis of resistance Arabs (Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq), to Saudis from various intellectual affiliations including atheists, to Qataris (primary benefactors of Hamas) and to Islamists/Ekhwanis who dream of restoring the Islamic Caliphate.

First, do Palestinians have a right to the disputed land? 100% yes, [proven by historical and DNA evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/) you know who else belongs to the disputed land, based on historical and DNA evidence? [Jews](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/)! Even the Quran says Jews lived in this land (e.g. Quran 5:21). Okay, but does that give the Jews the right to expel Palestinians from the land? 100% no! Okay so in what aspects of the conflict do I disagree with most Arabs on? We disagree on the selected time period (to many Arabs it's conveniently 1948-present) we use to evaluate the Palestinian issue. And in many problems of in life, you cannot hope to solve the problem without taking a few steps back to see the problem more clearly.

Look, I explicitly told Israelis that their extremists in the Knesset need to recognize the right of Palestinians to the land otherwise [we won't be able to reach a satisfactory solution for all sides](https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/1966y7g/an_opinion_by_a_propeace_saudi_that_wont_please/). But the extreme right-wing Israelis are not the only obstacle that stands between us and peace/two-state solution (or one state, two federations). Both sides are sick and tired of this conflict. So why have all peace efforts so far failed? [Prince Bandar bin Sultan](https://youtu.be/9XTSrlONiDU?si=OStWcp7RA6R0vOBf) described the failure of peace efforts and the continuous deterioration of the standards of living of the Palestinians in the last 75 years as an ""expected outcome"". Not due to lack of support from Arabs, but due to utter stupidity, unrealistic attitude in negotiation, and bad/emotional decision making in the politicians who represent the Palestinian interests. Hosni Mubarak, the late Egyptian president, spoke in in an interview on the reasons why accords like the [Camp David Accord (1978)](https://youtu.be/_NQZyvudBgM?si=TD-sWv-woQNrfpTx), for example, did not led to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. He blamed Palestinian politicians!

Prophet Muhammad said, ""Do the work, and pray for results."" He didn't say just pray while living in lala land. Forget about resolving this conflict militarily [(Prince Turki Al-Faisal agrees with me on that)](https://youtu.be/WCTla5lupzc?si=P60_zWk7GC7rxvl4). Israel had and will always have the full backing of the West, not to mention the fact that Isreal has in its arsenal up to 20 nuclear warheads for every Arab state. Suppose tomorrow every Arab state invaded Israel. What do you think Israel would do if they found themselves losing? And this begs the question, how much are we willing to bet (and sacrifice blood and resources) on the success of the military solution? You might say, but Allah promised victory over the Jews in the famous haddith/prophecy (also mentioned in Hamas's charter):

""The Muslims fight Jews in battle. And the Jews hide behind rocks and trees. But the rocks and trees speak: O Muslim, O servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me. Come kill him.""

First of all, how sure are you that the prophecy talks about contemporary Jews? Additionally, modern military tech enables you to see at night, in the morning, in a sand storm, even if you are hiding underground (for meters). Why would you need the rocks and trees to tell you where they are hiding? Therefore, this prophecy does NOT in any way describe the current conflict. Not even this era. Maybe a post-apocalyptic earth or something. Another example is not all Jews follow Antichrist in the Islamic prophecy. Only 70,000 Jews from Khorasan in Iran. Just that city! That's what the prophecy says. So I think it's not wise to take these prophecies into consideration in political decision-making!

The Oct 7 attack happened two weeks [after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that the two-state solution negotiations were going well](https://youtu.be/Y_u8ghPr3HE?si=4uGYiaqtkU9DsMLA). Coincidence? Iran and the axis of resistance Arabs believe that peace using diplomatic methods is not possible. Sure! They can think that. It's up to them. But why did they sabotage our attempt to achieve peace? If you think it's going to lead to nowhere, let it lead to nowhere! Think about it! Some people (some pro-Palestinians) don't want to see the Palestinian issue resolved. Why? Because they made fortunes from the Palestinian issue. Would you expect someone who is directly or indirectly benefiting from a problem to have the desire to solve it?

When faced with injustice, the oppressed has the right to resist. But is armed resistance the solution in every given scenario? Of course not! [Prince Turki Alfaisal spoke about this in a speech he made in an American university](https://youtu.be/WCTla5lupzc?si=y1VNXAnkeJutZjbp) where he invited the pro-Palestinians to get realistic for once in their lives. Speaking from a purely strategic feasibility perspective, resistance was the right choice for the Vietnamese people because they had jungles, thereby enabling them to use effective war tactics like gorilla warfare. Gaza is flat. Hamas weapons are pathetic. Okay, so you are saying, Allah will grant you victory, but you are not willing to do the work (i.e. living on fools hope and causing more Palestinians to die stupidly).

If you remember in the history of World War II, honor was something very important to the Japanese. They valued honor even more than Arabs do (they are similar to Arabs in this respect). However, the Japanese emperor surrendered to the Americans after Hiroshima and Nagasaki got nuked. The Japanese people considered the Emperor a God. And if he had told them to fight till the end, they would have fought to the end. If you were in the Japanese Emperor's shoes, would you fight to the end and preserve your honor? Or surrender and save your people from total annihilation?

-_-_-_-

I just want to comment on something I said above to clarify:

""Okay, does that give the Jews the right to expell Palestinians from the land? 100% no!""

This is how I look it. For centuries Jews were getting discriminated against, kicked of their land, enslaved, even killed or prosecuted just for being Jews. Then some crazy guy with a funny mustache went ahead and killed ~40% of Jews. People underestimate what the Holocaust did to Jews mentally even those who never stepped a foot in a concentration camp. It got to a point where Jews said ""We are done being everyone's punch bag! We are not gonna wait for the next Hitler to finish the job!"". Balfour Declaration was in 1917. Jews started slowly returning back to their ancestoral homeland, but not all Jews were interested in moving there. Europe was much more developed than the middle east. It wasn't until the Holocaust happened that all Jews realised, they must establish their own state, make their own decisions and protect their own people from the likes of the dude with the funny mustache. Am I understanding it right? 

I also think that Arabs did their fair share of colonizing. I just find it so ironic when they call Israeli Jews colonizers. Remind me again why did North Africa become part of the Arab world? I forgot. Did we ask them nicely to join the Arab family and they were like ""Of course!! We would love to!!""? 😅

Therefore, I think what's done is done. History is ugly, but the present does not have to be ugly. This land belongs to both, Israelis and Palestinians.

17zf46d,Lack of differing opinions on this subreddit,"I originally came to this subreddit a few days after the Oct 7 attacks in search of the truth and discussions about the events going on in Israel/Palestine. Personally, I am a staunch supporter of Israel and believe they are fighting a just war against the terrorists that butchered their people. However, I still believe that discussion is the best way to come to some consensus and understanding about the situation.  In the beginning, I read comments and views coming from either side of the aisle in almost every post here. But after a month I started to notice a decrease in actual discussions and an increasing polarity between sides. Which defeats the whole purpose of r/IsraelPalestine

I recently visited r/palestine and I saw post after post praising Hamas ""resistance"" fighters and almost every comment siding with Hamas. Seriously, it's not like they denounce Hamas and support the right of Palestinians to live and self-determination, they actively support and cheer terrorists. Not a single post about the evidence coming out of Al-Shifa or talking about the corruption within the PLO and Hamas leadership, it's truly an echo chamber over there. the scariest part of it all is that r/palestine has more than double the number of members that this sub has and nearly every post, comment, and idea there is not rooted in facts or evidence, just emotions from all the horrific injuries caught on camera on the ground in Gaza that they actively post.

190hxy6,It is NOT Genocide - here's why,"[The Genocide Convention](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml) defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

\-Killing members of the group;

\-Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

\-Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

\-Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

\-Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

“To constitute genocide, there must be a proven intent on the part of perpetrators to physically destroy a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Cultural destruction does not suffice, nor does an intention to simply disperse a group. It is this special intent, or dolus specialis, that makes the crime of genocide so unique. . .. Importantly, the victims of genocide are deliberately targeted - not randomly – because of their real or perceived membership of one of the four groups protected under the Convention (which excludes political groups, for example).” This means that to prove genocide one must show that the population was specifically targeted for destruction, and not as a result of collateral damage – even accepting that such collateral damage was avoidable and the military action disproportionate. It’s possible to hold that Israel has committed ‘war crimes’ but not genocide.

There is no exact number or percentage of a population that must be wiped out in order to find that a genocide was committed by killing a protected group “in part.” But it is well established that the “part” that is destroyed must be [a substantial number](https://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/acjug/en/krs-aj040419e.pdf%23page=16) relative to the total population of the group and which threatens the overall survival of the group.

To give a sense of how difficult this is to prove, the ICJ in [Bosnia & Herzegovina v Serbia](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/91), found “after determining that massive killings and other atrocities were perpetrated during the conflict throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. . .these acts were not accompanied by the specific intent that defines the crime of genocide, namely the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the protected group.” In [Croatia v Serbia](https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/118/118-20150203-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) , the ICJ rejected Croatia’s claim that a Serbian blockade of Dubrovnik, which had left the city without normal running water and electricity supplies for weeks and resulted in an extremely short supply of food and medicine, amounted to genocide under Article II(c).

The claim that Israel has expressed its genocidal intent hinges on numerous statements by politicians, pundits, and citizens – some of those statements are being purposefully misconstrued and selectively quoted. Others, admittedly, are, or would be genocidal, if state policy acted upon them. But bigoted ramblings do not amount to evidence that a State has a genocidal plan. This should be especially obvious when the country in question ensures freedom of expression, where anyone can make public comments no matter how loathsome. The focus, therefore, should be on those with *effective control* over the state’s military policy and the war effort, and to find if there is a causal connection between politicians’ comments and the military’s actions.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who is responsible for executing the war in Gaza, has stated that Israel’s target is  [not Palestinian civilians](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/International/israeli-defense-minister-talks-hamas-expanded-ground-operations/story?id=104450127)   [but Hamas as an org.](https://f5.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-769655) Israel’s Prime Minister has made  [similar comments](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/israel-not-successful-in-minimising-gaza-civilian-casualties-netanyahu)

Netanyahu’s reference to Israel’s ancient enemy, Amalek, in a speech he gave on October 29, has been cited as evidence of genocidal intent.  [Netanyahu's speech](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/event-statement281023) made no mention of the Palestinian People at all – only Hamas. And that Israel’s goal in the war was to destroy “Hamas’s military and governing capabilities and bringing the captives home.”

The Israeli President doesn’t have true executive authority, but his early comments about Gazan civilians have been misconstrued as genocidal. What is left out every time his comment is mentioned however, is that when pressed by a reporter to clarify whether the President meant to imply that civilians are legitimate targets, he said [""No, I did not say that""](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-gaza-isaac-herzog_n_65295ee8e4b03ea0c004e2a8)

Statements regarding sieging Gaza would also fail to rise to the level of dolus specialis. Gallant  [declared on October 9](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2023/10/9/israeli-defence-minister-orders-complete-siege-on-gaza)  “a complete siege…no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed.” However, in reality, Gaza has a border with Egypt, and Israel [restored the water supply](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/15/israel-resumes-water-supply-to-southern-gaza-after-us-pressure) within a few days of Gallant’s announcement.  [Gaza receives only 10% of its water from Israel](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/middleeast/gaza-water-access-supply-mapped-dg/index.html#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20about%2090%25%20of,Israel%27s%20national%20water%20company%2C%20Mekorot) of its water from Israel, with the remaining coming from Gaza’s own groundwater wells. Hamas has also boasted of its ability to  [turn water pipes into rockets](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/10/eu-funded-water-pipelines-hamas-rockets/)  which has worsened Gaza’s water situation. Food, water and medical aid have been and still are entering the Gaza Strip. Human beings cannot survive more than a few days without water and more than four-to-six weeks without food. Clearly (and thankfully), Gaza is not the victim of a prolonged, genocidal, siege; otherwise, the death toll would already be in the hundreds of thousands or more. Adding to Gazans’ misery are reports of [Hamas seizing aid](https://abc7chicago.com/israel-news-war-hamas-gaza/14226565/) meant for desperate people, [which would not be the first time](https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/107518) Hamas has done this and killing a 13-year-old boy as civilians were trying to grab essentials for themselves. A senior member of Hamas, Musa Abu Marzouk, declared that any aid coming into Gaza [must first be distributed to Hamas fighters, and only what remains after to civilians](https://t.me/yaffaps/19865)

On November 8, the BBC published a story about Gazans [receiving warning calls from the IDF](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67327079) before Israel would strike- this is strange behavior from a country that wants to commit genocide, as would using expensive bombs when cheaper ones (e.g., napalm) or even cheap WMDs (e.g., chemical weapons) would be much more effective for mass killing. Countries with the intent and ability to commit genocide do so - the N\*zis killed over 30,000 Jews at Babi Yar in under two days. Iraq in its  [Anfal campaign](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/ANFALINT.htm) in 1988 killed, within a few months, up to two or more times the number of Kurds than Israel has managed to kill Palestinians (both combatants and civilians) in 75 yrs.

Historically, in a genocide, the targeted victim population suffers a devastating population decline:

The Holocaust: Between 1939 and 1945, N\*zi Germany and its allies murdered two out of every three Jews in Europe.

The Timor-Leste Genocide: Indonesia’s 24 yr invasion & occupation of East Timor, killed off about 180,000 Timorese civilians, or nearly a third of the pre-occupation population. More than half of those were killed within a year of the occupation and most deaths were the result of starvation and disease.

The Rwanda Genocide: In 1994, Rwanda’s Hutu majority embarked on a slaughter of the Tutsi minority and their moderate Hutu allies. In just 100 days, up to 800,000 people were exterminated. 75 percent of Rwanda's Tutsi population was wiped out. Throughout the course of the genocide, the average life expectancy in Rwanda collapsed, plummeting from around 50 to less than 20.

The Holodomor: 10% of Ukraine’s population perished in the early 1930s as a result of a man-made famine under the regime of Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin. The famine has been seen as an instrument to break Ukrainian national aspirations. Btw, popular anti-Israel academic Norman Finkelstein, who has condemned Israel in the harshest terms, has stated that [the Holodomor was not a genocide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JISvvx-s79g) and that  [Russia has the historical right to invade Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTrQLVX2kAo)

Compare to Gaza War…

According to Hamas, as of December 2, 2023 approximately 15,000 Gazans have been killed. Why am I using this date and not today where the number is over 21,000!? Because, first, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, after November 19, fatalities ceased being reported by the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Instead, the fatalities are reported by the Gaza Government Media Office whose [""methodology is not known""](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-57) Second, even with significantly higher fatality figures, it doesn't change the analysis.

The Gaza Strip has about 5,751-people per sq km (14,900 people per sq mile) — [making it extremely densely populated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/17/gaza-size-population-comparison/). ‎Gaza City, which has been hit by Israeli airstrikes more than any other part of Gaza, has a population density of about 13,000+ people per sq km (36,000 per sq mile), which is denser than any US city. In some neighborhoods of Gaza City, [density reaches 30,000 people per sq km](https://www.ft.com/content/7b618433-ba5f-4e92-a3e0-d5d41d6d17f8) (77,000 per sq mile).

Israel purportedly used at least [40,000 tons of explosives](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-dropped-40-000-tons-of-explosives-on-gaza-strip-since-oct-7-says-media-office/3065385) by the end of November 2023. This is equivalent to 10x the explosives that were used against Dresden in February 1945, which killed 25,000 Germans in two days (3.96% of the city’s population). It is also 20x the explosives that were dropped on Tokyo in March1945, which killed 130,000 Japanese (1.94% of the population) and 20x the explosives dropped on Hamburg in late-July 1943, which killed around 40,000 Germans (6.3% of the population). And it is  [double the explosive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/5908/Israel-hit-Gaza-Strip-with-the-equivalent-of-two-nuclear-bombs) (78,000 dead on impact, or 22% of the population). Moreover, unlike Germany and Japan, which had some air raid shelters to protect their civilians, Gaza’s government has not built any bomb shelters for its people. [The tunnel network Hamas uses is for its fighters and leadership, not for civilian shelter.](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/tunnels-built-to-protect-hamas-fighters-not-civilians-terrorist-official-2455812-2023-10-30)

It is inexplicable that Israel unleashes at least double the explosive power of a nuclear bomb on an area with between 6,000 and 30,000 people per sq km (15,000 and 77,000 people per sq mile), where civilians have no protection, and supposedly with the intent to kill as many Palestinians as possible, and yet fails to kill people in those historic numbers in either absolute terms, or, perhaps more critically, as a percent of the total population. A basic understanding of statistics would make one expect that indiscriminate carpet bombing, let alone bombing intending to destroy Palestinians as a people, of such a densely packed urban area would result in death rates many multiple times greater than what we currently have seen. To compare with Dresden again, if the Allies had dropped the same amount of explosives as Israel has done in Gaza, about 40 percent of the population would have been killed.

*Recall what I wrote previously about finding causality between comments and action - even taking all the terrible, and yes, genocidal things Israelis have said since Oct. 7 - the above indicates there is a lack of causality between those extreme and horrid comments and IDF actions.*

Palestinian civilian deaths cannot be used as evidence of Israeli genocide without taking into account Hamas’ own role in endangering and disregarding Palestinian civilian life. [According to int'l humanitarian law](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule24), each party to a conflict must, to the extent feasible, remove civilians under their control from the vicinity of military objectives. Israel’s warning to civilians of impending military operations, via calls, leaflets, and QR codes, although clearly challenging to implement effectively in such a small area, is at least an attempt to comply with this rule. In contrast, Hamas, the ruling authority in Gaza responsible for civilian welfare, has not only failed to comply with its legal obligations, but has intentionally violated them. [Hamas has used hospitals to detain and torture political prisoners](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/), to station armed fighters, making the hospitals a potential military target, and has [threatened journalists for reporting on such activities](https://www.liberation.fr/planete/2014/07/22/le-hamas-fait-pression-sur-la-presse_1068537/).  [Hamas also has a history of firing rockets from civilian areas and storing munitions in civilian buildings](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/03/palestinian-armed-groups-killed-civilians-on-both-sides-in-attacks-amounting-to-war-crimes-during-2014-gaza-conflict/). While this does not absolve Israeli forces from all their responsibilities towards Palestinian civilians, it is further proof that the civilian death rate alone cannot be used as the sole measure of genocide.

There is another problem to consider when reviewing the number of casualties, which is that even Hamas’ ministry of Health does not claim all are civilians. If one follows Hamas’ [news agency](https://twitter.com/ShehabAgency) and social media in Arabic, the organization does not use the word ‘civilian’(مَدَني ) everyone is a ‘martyr’ (شهيد). They will often state if the deaths are women and children, but it is not clear, when the casualties are men, if they are civilians or combatants (Hamas videos of Gazans firing on Israeli troops with RPGs show them in civilian clothing). In prior conflicts, Hamas has also [instructed Gazans](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28292908) to always mention “innocent civilians” when discussing casualties and that [anyone killed should, before anything else, be called a civilian or citizen of Gaza or Palestine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxzZ5cm8ZCw). It is also unclear who exactly fits the definition of a ‘child.’ A 17-year-old is not a child in the same way as a 5-year-old and we know [Hamas recruits teenagers](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hamas-grows-with-young-recruits-eager-to-fight-israelis/) for its military wing. It is unknown how many of these are among the casualties.

\-Do the 1200 lives of Oct 7 have more value than the 30K in Gaza? You can say you doubt the numbers, but I am sure that ultimately there are way more than 1200 Palestinians killed. If you think the lives taken in Gaza are justified, please explain why. How many Palestinian lives is one Jewish life worth?

\- I also heard the argument of ""Hamas uses civilians as Human shields,"" can you clarify what you mean by that? and how does that justify the Gaza death toll?

\-Why do you think Hamas attacked on Oct 7? Why do you think Hamas exists? I know people automatically like to throw it all on antisemitism and try to cite random ayat from the Quran without context so please don't do that. Why do you think Hamas allows Christians to reside in Gaza and not Jews? Why Jews? Again, I want to understand so please answer rationally.

\-If you grew up in WB or Gaza would you be pro-israel?

\-Do you think that the war on Hamas will actually help achieve peace for Israelis? what about palestinians?

\-Explain the mental gymnastics here: The West Bank and Gaza are not officially part of Israel, so some argue that Israel cannot be deemed an apartheid state since it extends equal rights to all its citizens, and those living in the West Bank and Gaza aren't counted as such. Yet, Israelis have the right to move to WB whenever they want and reside in it (some parts of it), and Israel controls everything entering and leaving Gaza, and Israel controls Area C (and B's security) - also it practically is in control of Area A, as its military is free to raid whenever. Given this control over these areas, how do you justify the people living in them not being citizens? Do you geniuinely believe this is not apartheid?

\-Pro-Israelis who oppose a Palestinian state, what should the Palestinains do? you do not want them to have a state, and you do not want the integrated into an israeli state because the state would lose its Jewish nature,. What should they do then?

\-do you genuinely believe that being antisemitic is uniquely evil? as in, do you think anti-semitism is worse than other kinds of hatred? like racism or islamaphobia or homophobia, etc? if so why?",29/03/24 16:10:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bqt2aj/important_questions/,55,340,412,Oct 7,top,all
1b6qpp8,Questions for western leftists,"First of all— I agree that horrific things are happening in Gaza, and I would very much like for them to stop. I have many issues with the actions of the Israeli government. But I’m also confused by a number of statements I’ve seen. So here are some questions I have (feel free to only answer one/some)

1. What does a “free Palestine” mean to you? A one-state or two-state solution? Who would be in charge of the land currently controlled by Israel and who would be in control of Gaza? If a new government replaces Israel, how should it be appointed? What does “from the river to the sea” mean to you, specifically?

2. Why are Palestinians considered indigenous but not the Jews? Where would these “settler” Jews/Israelis “return” to?

3. What is your definition of Zionism?

4. In your opinion, who is considered a “Palestinian Jew”? 

5. How should Israel negotiate the return of the hostages?

6. What is considered anti-semitism in your opinion?

7. Do you consider Hamas “freedom fighters”? If not, how do you think they should be dealt with?

I don’t really want to dump my own opinions with my own biases but this doesn’t meet the character limit as is. I’m an American Jew and feel that there’s been a crazy uptick in antisemitism since Oct 7. Again, **I do not condone the actions of the state of Israel** but I have been seeing the wildest (imo) takes. I’m genuinely trying to understand what other people believe and what it actually means when I see these things on my social media. It feels like a lot of performative activism to me.",05/03/24 00:07:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1b6qpp8/questions_for_western_leftists/,54,476,277,Oct 7,top,all

1bnmt5f,Why doesn't the world condemn Oct 7?,"The terrorist attack by the Islamic State on the concert hall in Moscow 100% deserves to be condemned, but why hasn't the UN condemned Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel?

Jihadists brutally killed over a hundred people in Moscow and over 1000 (let's emphasize that that's over one thousand!) in Israel. October 7 also involved mass-torture and mass-rape which makes it even more insane. Hamas also took over 200 hostages. Over 100 of those hostages remain in captivity by Hamas in Gaza. According to the freed hostages/witnesses, rape is also occurring against the hostages still in Gaza. 

How does the UN Security Council not see the double standard here? I only see it as complete hypocrisy on the part of Russia and China who voted down the US Ceasefire on the principle that the US put it forward. Why were so many countries against the US ceasefire which called for the release of hostages? The new ceasefire at least calls for the release of hostages, but still does not condemn Hamas. Even if you make the argument that Israel is the aggressor, that does not give anyone a right to murder, rape, and torture Israelis in cold blood. I personally don't think the argument for Israel being the aggressor makes sense since their offensive is in response to October 7. I think you can debate how they should have responded. But how does the devastation in Gaza make what happened before ok? How is what Hamas did ever ok?

For the record, this is not a post saying there should or shouldn't be a ceasefire, but a post specifically about why the global community has failed to condemn Hamas and the Oct 7 attack?",25/03/24 19:40:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bnmt5f/why_doesnt_the_world_condemn_oct_7/,51,536,284,Oct 7,top,all
1bpe2zf,Debunking the narrative that not enough aid is entering Gaza to prevent starvation using UNRWA data.,"(Reposted due to miscalculations. Hopefully I got them sorted out this time.)

I've been wanting to write a detailed post on this subject for a while but had difficulty finding data that would not be immediately rejected by pro-Palestinians. Thankfully, UNRWA itself has done me a huge favor and started publishing a [very detailed report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTVkYmEwNmMtZWYxNy00ODhlLWI2ZjctNjIzMzQ5OGQxNzY5IiwidCI6IjI2MmY2YTQxLTIwZTktNDE0MC04ZDNlLWZkZjVlZWNiNDE1NyIsImMiOjl9&pageName=ReportSection3306863add46319dc574) regarding the distribution of aid in the Gaza Strip.

The first section of the dataset shows the number of days the crossings into Gaza have been open, the number of trucks that have passed through them, as well as their contents.

According to the datasheet, the crossings have been open a total of 152 days since the data started being recorded on Oct 21st. In other words, between the dates of Oct 21st 2023 and March 26th 2024 (yesterday) the crossings were only closed for a total of 5 days.

In total, 17,599 trucks entered Gaza during that period. 9,231 of them from the Rafah crossing and 8,368 of them through the Kerem Shalom crossing:

>\-11,771 or 66.8% were food items (food and water).  
>  
>\-3,531 or 20% were non food items.  
>  
>\-1,094 or 6.2% were medical supplies.  
>  
>\-908 or 5.1% were mixed items (food, water, and non-food items).  
>  
>\-294 or 1.6% were uncategorized.

[According to the UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142622), each truck carries approximately 20 tons:

>""To gauge the volume, a convoy of five trucks is carrying, among other things,100 tonnes of food parcels. That’s about 20 tonnes of food per truck. Other vehicles contain additional donations of ready-to-eat food that continue to arrive.""

If 11,771 trucks hold 20 tons, a grand total of 235,420 tons (213,569,431.4kg or 519,012,257.6lb) of food items have entered Gaza since Oct 21st.

Divided by 157 days this comes out to 1,360,314.8kg or 3,305,810.5lb of food items per day.

With a population of 2,375,259 in Gaza this comes out to 0.57kg or 1.39lb of food items per person per day.

As we scroll further down the datasheet we can find a section that details the cargo of each truck that enters Gaza as well as its date of entry, donation source, and which crossing it used. Using the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tMA9U_AfM-1MSYfBhKfx-4FAkrAlmarm/edit#gid=1529391260) we can deduce that approximately (as some carry both water and food) 7.1% of trucks are carrying water and the rest is carrying food.    

Despite this calculation, I will use 0.59kg/1.43lb for the sake of argument without including mixed items, airdrops, maritime aid shipments, or aid that has passed through crossings besides Rafah and Kerem Shalom to further increase the quantities per day. If I have time I’ll make a follow-up post in which I break down the spreadsheet for more accurate data but for now this will have to be good enough.

According to an [article](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/calorie-counting-made-easy) published by Harvard Medical School (although many other sources exist), men need approximately 1,800 calories per day while women need 1,200 to maintain their weight.

While aid distribution would be more varied in reality, 0.57kg of rice would be [2,052 calories](https://www.nutritionvalue.org/nutritioncalculator.php?servings=1&meal_name=Meal&id_0=169760&serving_0=1%20kg%20=%201000%20g&amount_0=0.57&final_weight=&utm_source=share-by-url) per day per person while 0.57kg of flour would be [2,075 calories](https://www.nutritionvalue.org/nutritioncalculator.php?servings=1&meal_name=Meal&id_0=169761&serving_0=1%20kg%20=%201000%20g&amount_0=0.57&final_weight=&utm_source=share-by-url) per day per person which is well above starvation levels.

While being somewhat outdated at this point (Dec 8th-Feb 24th) the [World Food Programme](https://www.wfp.org/publications/202324-wfp-palestine-monthly-market-dashboard) breaks down truckloads as follows:

As we can see after parsing the data not only is there enough food entering Gaza to provide food for everyone each day, but there is an excess of food per person.

I have not used a single pro-Israel source in my post and all the data is directly from UNRWA. My five additional references were from UN News, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, WFP, Harvard (which is hardly considered to be pro-Israel), and a nutrition calculation site which would be classified as unbiased.

It should be mentioned that my post does not address the issue of food distribution and simply debunks the claim that not enough food is entering Gaza to prevent starvation. I will not be providing my sources as to the increased efforts at distributing aid in this post as they are provided by Israel rather than the UN and thus will be rejected outright by pro-Palestinians.

pmjbjn,The liberal blindside with respect to Israel.,"Why Israel as a safe haven for Jews from around the world?

Jews have been persecuted from around the world for over 2,000 years. Israel was a hope that any anti-Semitism could be disregarded and parried, because there was a state to shield Jews. Jerusalem is the land the Jews pray to, and there has been a continuous Jewish community within Jerusalem and other territories within contemporary Israel. They could not have settled elsewhere.

Sources: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution\_of\_Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews)

Why is a safe-haven required today, if anti-Semitism is culturally unacceptable?

This is because every state will have times of prosperity, and times of depression. When these times of depression arrive, Jews will be scapegoated. As is evident in contemporary Western society, anti-Semitism has been rising worldwide.

It is not solely due to the existence of Israel. If Israel didn’t exist? The justification would become “Jews insidiously govern society, through their grasp on the banks and media,” or “Jews are termites that must be exterminated from society.” Israel is the merely the latest justification in a torrent of justification throughout history. Anti-Semitism is a mutating disease, and that is why a Jewish state is required. The tentacles of anti-Semitism are gradually enveloping the Democratic and Republican parties. The Democrats and Republicans will call out anti-Semitism that exists on the other side, but they will not acknowledge the anti-Semitism harbored by their party. Here is my analogy for it: “They are both so concentrating on extinguishing the fire on their neighbor’s home, that they don’t realize their home has already burnt down.” Young people harbor anti-Semitic attitudes, even though, other forms of hatred have attenuated among younger generations (Note – Blatant anti-Semitism is higher among the right than the left). Jews are the “canary in the coal mine,” and if there wasn’t a Jewish state, Jews would be whipsawed by anti-Semitism.

Why a Jewish majority within Israel?

Having a Jewish majority does not presuppose that if Jews were a minority the governing authorities would be raging anti-Semitism, but it does presuppose that in the absence of a Jewish majority, Jewish do not have institutional backing to shield themselves from anti-Semitism. Israeli will perennially remain a flawed democracy, because its aim is to retain a Jewish majority. The principal purpose of Israel is to be a Jewish Democratic State, not a Democratic Jewish State. This signifies that Jewish demographics will consistently supersede democracy, because there is no other guarantor of Jewish safety.

192qa4l,Much Ado About Nothing; Bogus Claims That Israel Indiscriminately Kills Journalists,"**Source for data:** [https://cpj.org/2024/01/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/](https://cpj.org/2024/01/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/)

The data from October 7, 2023, to January 7, 2024, highlights that the majority of individuals categorized as journalists in the Israel-Gaza conflict may not truly be journalists. Most casualties occurred incidentally during airstrikes, not as intentional targets or while actively practicing journalism. These casualties are unfortunate but expected in urban warfare.

Out of the 75 non-Israeli reported journalist casualties, *only four present genuinely questionable circumstances*. ~~Two were killed while accompanying a terrorist, and the other two were recording airstrikes, a peril inherent in wartime reporting.~~ Two were terrorists, one was recording airstrikes, and the other was recording a battle between Hezbollah and IDF forces - several KMs from the border, at dusk, while using recording equipment that profiles like an ATGM. These are perils inherent in wartime reporting.

Claims decrying Israel's intentional targeting of journalists are unwarranted and disproportionate upon reviewing the data.

Breaking down the categories:

**Terrorist Affiliated Journalists (40):** Individuals associated with terrorist media are considered propagandists and are inseparable from their organizations' military wings. \*\* This is not to say that they warrant summary execution. But it does make it reasonable to assume they may have been near legitimate military targets. CPJ indicates that these reporters work for media affiliated with groups like Hamas, PIJ, Hezbollah, and more. There is nothing that indicates these people were killed in targeted strikes. Almost all of them appear to have died incidentally in airstrikes and not while working or marked as press.  \*\*

**Freelance Journalists (25):** Some freelancers participated in massacres on October 7, making their journalistic credentials questionable. Safeguarding them during active war is challenging due to lack of organization and communication with the IDF. \*\* As before, this does not warrant the death penalty necessarily, but the data does not reflect that they were specifically targeted as members of the press or that any of them were working and identified as press at the time of their death. \*\*

**Israeli Journalists (4):** Several journalists were killed by Hamas and Palestinians, but there has been no notable outcry in their names. \*\* This is mostly to say that, while these deaths have not been widely publicized, they have been included in the reporting that promulgates the idea that Israel is targeting members of the press. These deaths are similar to most of the other deaths here in that they do not appear to have been killed because they were journalists. Rather, they were killed because they were Israeli. Similarly, the other people here died because they were civilian casualties of war, not *because* they were journalists. \*\*

**State Sponsored Media (6):** State-sponsored journalists died incidentally during airstrikes on legitimate military targets, not as intentional targets.

**Accredited Media (4):** The circumstances of the deaths of these four journalists are examined individually in more detail below.

* **Oct. 13, 2023:**
   * Issam Abdallah // Reuters (Beirut-based videographer)
      * Killed near the Lebanon border by shelling coming from the direction of Israel while covering the back-and-forth shelling near Alma Al-Shaab in southern Lebanon between Israeli forces and Hezbollah. They were recording live, and using equipment that looks similar to an ATGM launching platform from afar. \*\* This was during an active engagement with Hezbollah. According to reporting by NPR, “The news teams were covering clashes along the border where Israel and the militia Hezbollah were trading fire…Reuters said the journalists were over half a mile from the border with Israel when they were attacked.” These attacks also happened after dusk. \*\*
* **Dec. 15, 2023:**
   * Samer Abu Daqqa // Al-Jazeera Arabic
      * Killed by a drone strike while covering the aftermath of nightly Israeli strikes on a United Nations school sheltering displaced people in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza. Though Palestinian sources say Samer was clearly marked as press, these are the risks you face in wartime reporting. Especially at night in an active zone.
* **Jan. 7, 2024:**
   * Hamza Al Dahdouh // Al-Jazeera (son of Al-Jazeera Gaza bureau chief Wael Al Dahdouh) & Mustafa Thuraya // Agence France-Presse (AFP)
      * ~~Killed in an Israeli drone strike along with freelance journalist Mustafa Thuraya while driving to an assignment in southern Gaza.

This is an interesting thing going on, because on the one hand you have this outrage over sexual assault of women, and on the other hand you have an outrage over wartime atrocity propaganda. Both are worth being outraged over, but what are we talking about here. Were there really rapes committed by the IDF, or are these claims Pallywood atrocity propaganda?

191p5z7,Help Me Better Understand Dead Journalists in Gaza,"At the time of this writing, the claim I'm seeing on Reuters is that Hamas' count of journalists killed in this conflict is 109. I find this to be a disturbingly large number, as the death counts purportedly dwarf so many past conflicts.

While the number reported from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is smaller — roughly 80, with 72 in Gaza — that's still a very high and very bothersome figure.

So, what is the claimed reason on the Israeli side? 

Are there more journalists per capita in Gaza than in other places?

Are journalists doing something to put themselves in harm's way at a higher rate in this region than in other conflicts?

If the reason is that they were believed to be hostile, has anyone done any work to quantify what portion of these journalists were alleged to have been working for Hamas? Or how many were proven to have a crossed an ethical red line like holding a grenade or not warning about Oct 7 events when doing so could have saved lives?

Looking over the list on CPJ, it seems like many of these journalists worked for Hamas-affiliated networks, but is that enough evidence for you to consider the death justified? Or do you think that might set a worrisome precedent?

Are you familiar with the arguments that Israel is targeting journalists, and can you point to good published argument against these claims?

I am interested in both facts and genuine opinions, and TBH mostly interested in pro-Israel arguments. The other side on this particular question is both self-evident and incredibly easy to find.

18wbho6,Are people antisemitic or am I seeing this the wrong way?,"Hi guys, I wanted to hear your opinions on this.
When I see people posting anti-Israel stuff and it's from a Muslim or Arab, I can totally understand why they choose to side with people of their religion. It makes perfect sense to me.

What bothers me is the following: I see people that have no connection to this at all posting extremely hateful and antisemitic stuff. When I ask them why they are doing it, their response is usually something like ""I'm a humanitarian"".
This would be a fair answer if they posted about other things that have been going on in the world.

One example would be the 400K dead in Yemen along with the millions that are starving. There is no shortage of issues like this around the world (currently). But I've never seen them post anything about any issues... But all of a sudden they are humanitarians (when it involves Jews).
All of a sudden they feel this deep desire to speak up as loudly as they can. All of a sudden they have become so angry about something that’s happening in the world. 

This doesn’t add up in my head. Maybe I’m missing something. But from where I’m sitting I see a bunch of people who could care less about any of the injustices around the world, and out of nowhere have become warriors of peace and justice. 
Although, when 1200+ were murdered in Israel on Oct 7, they didn’t seem to be humanitarians, or have a voice for justice. 

So my question is, how am I not suppose think they are antisemitic? Am I missing something here? Maybe I’m looking at it the wrong way? I would love to hear your thoughts on this. I’m open to anything and everything.",02/01/24 00:29:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18wbho6/are_people_antisemitic_or_am_i_seeing_this_the/,41,291,296,Oct 7,top,all
18cbc12,Results from Arab World Survey: How do you make peace with a people that don't want peace?,"How is peace possible with such support of war/terror attacks from the Palestinian people? According to the poll, the majority desire is not a compromise or a two state solution, but a single Palestinian state. How do you compromise with a people that seek to eradicate your country?

&#x200B;

**Survey from Arab World for Research and Development.** Both English and Arabic results available.

**Limited sample size:** 668 people (277 from Gaza. 391 from Westbank)

Yes I am aware of the challenges with surveys... but we get what we have and not what we dream about.

Very sad to see the level of destruction and humanitarian crisis for the residents of Gaza and what fraction of people have lost family members or their homes.

Also very sad to see that the vast majority of surveyed people support the militant branches of the local terror cells, the terrorist attacks, and express the desire to eradicate Israel. 

Just realized I can't put snips of the tables in here...

**74.7%** of surveyed people desire a single state of Palestine (from the river to the sea).

**75.0%** of respondents said they ""Extremely support"" (59.3%) or ""somewhat support"" (15.7%) attack on Oct 7th.

**Support of military wings of Terrorist Groups within Gaza:**

**84.2%** of respondents have a ""Very Positive"" (59.9%) or ""Somewhat Positive"" (24.3%) view of the group Islamic Jihad

**80.2%** of respondents have a ""Very Positive"" (49.4%) or ""Somewhat Positive"" (17.5%) view of the group Al Aqsa Brigade

17mqhzw,Jews are treated different than other groups - this war is another sad example,"Israel seems to be on trial. People are demanding ceasefire but Israel has tried that. Israelis want live in peace and don't want violence. The fact is that there was a ceasefire on Oct 6 and Hamas broke it on Oct 7 when they raped, beheaded, kidnapped and murdered 1,400 Israelis.

&#x200B;

Hamas' only mission is to eliminate Israel and to murder Jews. It's not about land. Hamas doesn't want peace. They want death, even of their own people so they can villainize Israel, which is why they purposely put their civilians in harm's way.

&#x200B;

Israel is always on the defensive. Israel must always explain to the world every move they make. Israel is by no means perfect but it is a civilized democracy. Even in war,  Israel does what they can to protect innocent Palestinians. Israel sends fliers and warnings to evacuate, they allowed humanitarian aid, they started ground operations at the risk of their own soldiers because they are more precise than airstrikes to avoid civilian casualties, etc.

&#x200B;

The world had to take out Germany in WW2. The world had to take out the Taliban. And now the world must take out Hamas. There are no gray areas here.

17tal75,The Scenes of Genocide I Saw in Israeli Morgues By Qanta A. Ahmed (Wall Street Journal),"A fetal heartbeat flutters and then stills, a bullet lodged in the embryonic heart. The mother survives the shooting and her child’s stillbirth. A body that has been decomposing for almost three weeks lies on the autopsy table, riddled with knife and bullet wounds. Another is nearby, the man’s blue-tooth receiver still clipped onto his shirt. Death came as a surprise.  
  
This is Israel. I arrived on Oct. 19 to spend 10 days as a human-rights observer with the permission of the nation’s Foreign Affairs Ministry and help from Israel Defense Forces officer Kobi Valer. As an observant Muslim, I felt a duty to come and bear witness. What I saw will remain with me forever.  
  
Hamas waged its attacks in the nation’s south, but hundreds of its victims have since been moved north. I encountered many of them at the morgues at the Shura military base near Ramle, some 15 miles southeast of Tel Aviv. I toured the Sammy Ofer Fortified Underground Emergency Hospital in Haifa, visiting the neonatal units whose tiny patients had recently been relocated in anticipation of further conflict. I examined bodies and ashes, incinerated teeth and bones. I saw toddlers, teens and adults, young and old, many of them bound, tortured and burned alive.  
  
One word continually came to mind: genocide. No matter how it emerges, the monster is easy to recognize. As a doctor, I had a rare and panoramic view of the aftermath: the targeted people’s long, agonizing journey to death.  
  
This isn’t the first time I have seen Islamist jihadism or even Islamist genocide. I’ve been to northwestern Pakistan and met child Tali-ban operatives groomed for suicide missions. I still attend to 9/11 first-responders in New York. I’ve been to post-ISIS Iraq to meet with Kurdish and Yazidi survivors of genocide. I’ve spoken with former ISIS child soldiers and the Peshmerga veterans of that brutal and bloody three-year war.  
  
The Oct. 7 genocide was different, more barbaric than anything before it. The attacks were cloaked in the language and metaphors of Islam, yet corrupted with cosmic enmity for the Jewish people, Judaism, global Jewry and the Jewish state. They revealed again that Islamism is a virulent impostor of Islam with intentions anathema to the faith. And there was no doubt of Islamism’s guilt: I saw real-time footage generated by the Hamas commandos’ own GoPro cameras. I heard phone calls exclaiming the Shahadah—the Islamic declaration of faith—as they murdered, executed, burned, pillaged and then broadcast their crimes.  
  
There is a commonality I have found in the face of such destruction. People struggle to find the words to describe what happened. Israelis I met were still searching for how to recount their experiences. Some talked about a second Shoah, a second Holocaust. One Israeli detective disagreed: “We can’t call this a holocaust—not because of the numbers—but because the Nazis were systematic and institutionalized the killing, and we can’t call it carnage, because ‘carnage’ is too nice a word.” He looked at me with a painful gaze. I found my own words strangled in silence, except one: genocide.  
  
Article 6 of the 1998 Rome Stat-ute of the International Criminal Court defines genocide as a crime against humanity in terms identical to the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Its essential element is intent “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”  
  
The Oct. 7 attack was premeditated, organized and targeted, seeking to destroy as many Israelis as possible. Hamas tortured and immolated its victims, including children, pregnant women and the unborn. Its men intentionally captured hostages, around 240 in total, reportedly from more than 40 countries.  
  
They had intent. Eyewitnesses told me the terrorists came with tablets loaded with maps of the kibbutzim, blueprints and floor plans of homes, names of families and specific knowledge of service records and where Israeli veterans were living. Others told me that some of the terrorists spoke Hebrew and lured the unwitting out of their safe rooms into certain death.  
  
This wasn’t like the pogroms of the 1880s, a frenzy of killing with rabid emotion. This was a methodically planned genocide. No such circumstances apply to Israel’s operation in Gaza, and so the description must not be the same. The sovereign state of Israel is destroying Hamas because Hamas is threatening Israel, which is working to mitigate civilian losses. The country has a duty to prevent further genocide against its people. Saying so doesn’t detract from the suffering of Palestinians who are captives of Hamas.  
  
Two weeks after the attack, Queen Rania of Jordan suggested that the butchering of children had yet to be “independently verified” as I examined images of their remains in Ramle. The deceit felt as barbaric as the atrocities. There is no context, no nuance, that justifies genocide. Its intention is the same throughout the ages: the destruction of a people.  
  
Israel, the West and the Muslim world must respond with necessary moral clarity: Define the Oct. 7 attacks as genocide. Legally designating the horrors as such ought to become a priority, independent of the war against Hamas, because the attacks need to be documented and prosecuted as crimes against humanity. Doing so is a matter of Jewish survival. The world has been silent in the face of Jewish genocide before. When we now say never again, we must mean it.

192krvo,Foolishness of Israel Prosecution in Hague,"The claims against Israel for genocide in Hague are ridiculous.

The overwhelming evidence of Hamas uses civilians and civilian infrastructure makes it impossible for any army engage such terror organisation with not civilians casualties.

An the reality is even worse - many civilians actively support Hamas, by deliberately distracting the IDF troops, by scoping military movement and location of forces, by holding Israeli kidnapped civilians and by hiding military supplies for Hamas.

And to make thing worse, for some unexplained reason, all the Arab states has some kind of a protection from being prosecuted in Hauge.

Basically, the meaning of this selective prosecution is that Israel can be shielded form prosecutions if there was a Jewish terror organisation which would do the worst atrocities imaginable.

It is also not clear as what is the role South Africa has into all of this, and what do they have to gain.
It is now known that the Palestinians also help SA with the prosecution, and that Jordan joined to those claims.


Neither of them - South Africa, the PLO and Jordan, are in a moral position to execute such a prosecution.

More specifically, the PLO, who announced that they will financially support the Oct 7 th massacre terrorists and constantly claiming that Hamas is an integrated part of the Palestinians.
That alone should have put the PLO on trial in Hauge.


Jordan as well, after Black September, how can they even be allowed to join this prosecution?

An South Africa - we all saw how they shot with live ammunition protestors.

18fgzz7,Refuting the claim that 'Palestinians/Arabs had nothing to deal with the Holocaust',"FOR MODS: I do not attempt to make comparisons to Palestinian Authority to Nazis/ neither intend to. I'm simply stating information found with actual events they partook in with Jews. If it breaks rule 6, take down the post as you may.

&#x200B;

This claim is mainly for the Westerners who want to look at every conflict with a Marxist/Intersectional Lense.

In a lot of media, it's becoming easy for the youth to label Israel as an apartheid state with outlets utilizing buzzwords such as ""systemic racism"" or ""oppressors"" when associating with Israel. Now, the way I'm defining buzzwords are alarms/whistles that allows people to form an opinion (with whoever these buzzwords are associated with) without having to do research.

This black and white approach has been very harmful to the Jewish community allowing increase in holocaust denial^(1) and antisemitism^(2).

We've heard the justification of these hateful actions because of the excuse that Israelis are the oppressors. However, when Pro-Palestinians bring up historical events painting it as Israel atrocities, most of the time its refusing to lack the context of the previous events. For example, the Arab Israeli conflict of 1948 is believed to have been an unjust act from Israel. But in reality, I will show you how it was actually a self-defense response to Anti-Jew/Pro-Nazi attack led by genocidal leadership (in Palestine).

&#x200B;

1. Hajj Amin al-Husseini, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and President of Mandate Palestine. Pro Palestinians don't like when I mention him because it will get dismissed that he either a) didn't contribute to much b) or didn't represent Palestinians views. However, the Huessini family was a well respect family and very powerful one to say the least in the Palestinian world (which explains how al-Husseini became the Grand Mufti). Husseini's success/popularity rose due to inciting aggression of violence against Jews (1920 Nebi Musa riots | a riot in reaction to Britain recognizing Jews having a state). Huesseini would commonly associate Jews with acts of wanting to incite violence such as attempting to kill Arabs or to destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque (which ironically Jews today are beaten up for even trying to enter). Eventually, Huessini was labeled as a ""Proclamation of the Grand Mufti to the Islamic World"" thus dismantling the idea of Husseini having no influence.^(3)

&#x200B;

2. Husseini was so good at spewing Jewish hate that he became 'friends' with a prominent leader named Adolf Hitler. (The Jewish Enemy by Jeffrey Herf pg. 179) ([https://imgur.com/a/yr5qgKS](https://imgur.com/a/yr5qgKS)). Nazi Germany and Husseini has such a familiar relationship with constant meetings, spreading each other's propaganda ^(4), and speaking light of each other publicly. Another thing I feel that I skipped over was Husseini's constant glossing over how the rhetoric against Jews was correspondent to the religion of Islam. This is what made antisemitism easy to spread with Islamic countries backing Huessini up this motive; we can back this up given that majority of Husseini's audience consisted of Arabs in the middle east who've associated Islam with their identity.

&#x200B;

3. This one has a bit of speculation so this proof isn't asurring nor definitive enough to be waving around. Around 1939, Hans Piekenbrock, a German intelligence colonel, has been appeared to have boasted 'It was only as a result of the money we gave (al-Husayni) that it was possible to carry out the revolt in Palestine'.^(5)

&#x200B;

4. Osman Kemal Haddad, Husseini's private secretary, traveled to Berlin Germany in 1940 to acknowledge and support Arab Nationalism and to discuss the ""Jewish Question""^(6). I don't think I have to disect this one much as we all know questions are only responded with by (Final) Solutions. For those who don't know, the Final Solution was implemented in the following year, 1941. Just to add some context, the Grand Mufti still had several relations in regards to handling Jewish migrating around Europe. So finally we have that famous image shared all over the internet with Huessini shaking hands with Hitler this is the meeting (PAY ATTENTION TO THE DATE: NOVEMBER 28, 1941) they held in 1941 to further discuss the ""Jewish Question"". After this meeting Hitler, had scheduled a conference called the Wannsee Conference (which was originally set to take place on December 9, 1941^(7) but got cancelled because of Pearl Harbor). This conference is what ultimately decided the Final Solution.

Backup for 7th source: [https://imgur.com/a/gUVtMaS](https://imgur.com/a/gUVtMaS)

Shortly after, Husseini encouraged more Arabs to help encourage genocide and Arabs from many nations (including Palestine) helped ensure that by 1948 over 860k jews were displaced from Arab countries.

&#x200B;

5) Today, the Grand Mufti's legacy is not tarnished but rather praised in recent society. He's been called a savior, martyr^(8), and hero according to Arabs/Palestinians. This acceptance of genocide never disappeared. Many leaders of Palestine have continued to admit their support the killing of Jews.^(9) The number one supporters of this opinion is Hamas. Who have amassed 46.6% from Gaza and 68.3% from the West Bank in amount of Palestinian Support. Which also concludes to a 70.4% | 77.7% in support for a one state solution.^(10)

&#x200B;

Now, it is weird that people argue Hamas aren't terrorist. So, I will leave them with this piece of propaganda left by Hamas for Palestinian children.^(11)

What do you believe anyway?

What should we do when Hamas and Hezbollah attacks? are idf secretly gamers who have cheat codes to physics to only hit those who fire against without casualty. should idf just know when an attack will occur and if not accept if somewhat shows sighns of hostility. that this sacred wokeness isnt really a priority over a need for people to exist.

what about racism? why are there no jews anywhere in the Middle East? because the Middle East is tolerant. why are there arabs in Israel because were an apartheid? Should we thank hamas and invite them in to be culturally sensitive? honestly im asking what do you want and what do you expect to happen?

People are saying for is to stop so no more lives are taken. people say that Palestinians wont do it again, or its understandable if they do so just take it and dont even mention how Hamas is seeking through Iran to improve its arms so is Hezbollah.  so no fighting back love is the answer do nothing wright? If countries care about gaza so much why doesn't egypt or Jordan give charity and offer more land instead of just expecting israel to wipe itself out of existence?

is this okay should it be tolerated for understanding and what do you think independence will create? because 2006 gave that answer so repeating and not fight back is a peaceful way all to make people who protest happy.

ps i meant pro Palestinians.

1ax5zty,A reply I wrote to a deleted thread,"Someone made a thread about Israel in some other sub, and I wrote a reply that I think is valuable. Unfortunately, OP soon removed the thread, so my efforts went to waste. I decided to repost it here because why not:

(full disclosure: I'm an Israeli who lost acquaintances during 7.10, or as I prefer to call it, the Netanyahu massacre)  
  
The first thing that must be clarified is that \[there is no genocide in Gaza\](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/israel-winning-gaza?fbclid=IwAR1oDGmtkzbNTWrQMjfa406iTW3uHEQzZ0C54CgCrY0tK6iyTdjqkHHZ8as). Hamas has entrenched itself deeply into the civilian population to deliberately increase civilian casualties and yet, the combatant to collateral deaths in the operation is literally the best in the history of warfare, a consequence of IDFs unprecedented efforts to minimise civilian casualties given the circumstances.  
  
Israel must ensure its safety and the only way to do so is uprooting Hamas. This will happen eventually either way. Hamas has the option to release the hostages and surrender but they choose to keep sacrificing the Gazan civilians and making outrageous demands in return for a cease fire. A sacrifice which they do \[openly and proudly\](https://www.algemeiner.com/2023/12/08/hamas-says-it-is-proud-to-sacrifice-gazans-to-defeat-israel/). In particular, accepting their terms means giving them the leeway they need to regroup and repeat the Netanyahu massacre, \[as they said they would\](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-official-says-group-aims-to-repeat-oct-7-onslaught-many-times-to-destroy-israel/amp/).  
  
Echoing the preposterous accusations of genocide and failing to take a moral stand is rewarding this type of warfare. If the outcome of this conflict is that the world gives terrorists a free pass as long as they entrench themselves deep enough into civilians, the result would just be that we see much more of this type of warfare in the future. This is not just about Israel's security, it's about not allowing such a dangerous norm to set in.  
  
You would notice that while the self righteous west is very inflammatory about this conflict, most of the Sunnite Arab world (most notably Egypt, UAE and Saudi Arabia) quietly support Israel's endeavour. That's because they know very well that Hamas is not just Israel's problem but a threat to regional and global stability and to normalisation of Arab nations with the west. At the bottom line, Israel is doing everyone a service, including Palestinians.  
  
There are many valid criticisms about Israel, mostly about its current ghoulish government and their utter refusal to engage in international discourse about the day after in Gaza. And still, portraying both sides as ""just as bad"" is a position that could only be either morally bankrupt or ignorant. In your case, I believe it is the latter, due to your shallow exposition.  
  
Also, that's maybe besides the point, but remember that while for you this is a matter of hypothetical discussion, for others it is a source of deep grief and trauma. Imagine how it feels like for an Israeli who lost literally dozens of acquaintances on that day, many of whom raped, tortured and mutilated, seeing someone with an obviously shallow understanding of the conflict decreeing them ""just as bad"" for doing what's necessary to ensure such a thing never happens again.",22/02/24 13:07:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ax5zty/a_reply_i_wrote_to_a_deleted_thread/,31,152,502,Oct 7,top,all
18rmtpd,Palestinian Wafa News Agency Ignores Hamas Atrocities,"Remember how the recent Palestinian poll reported that 90% of Pals believed Hamas didn’t commit war crimes on Oct 7?

Could it be bc the official Pal news agency, Wafa, didn’t report them whatsoover?  Searching for ‘Hamas’ from Oct 6-8 on Wafa returns *zero* articles. News blackout on Hamas articles, wonder why?

Searching for all Wafa articles from Oct 7-8 returns no references to the massacres of Israeli civilians.  Lots of articles on Israeli ‘aggression’, though.  Yes, while Israeli civs were being raped burned murdered and paraded through gaza, Wafa reports such journalistic scoops as:

* Deaths, injuries among Palestinian civilians as Israel attacks two homes in Gaza
* Qatar urges international community to promptly respond to Israeli violations
* Several Palestinians injured, some seriously, by Israeli gunfire in Jerusalem

All these articles are *dated* *Oct 7 itself.*  

Pals may try to refute this by saying the PA doesn’t report on Hamas bc they are rivals.  Not so.  Searching for Hamas articles on Wafa without a date filter returns many articles.

Another refutation might be to claim the atrocities weren’t reported in Arab media generally.  Not so.  Al-Ahram and Al-Arabiya reported them the same day.

Now I understand if Palestinian Wafa wants to spin the attacks as being ultimately ’the fault of the occupation’ and the need to resume peace talks.  But to not report the atrocities at all, that is just non-factual and info suppression, and does much to explain Pal denialism and extremism re this war, which is ultimately doing Pals no favors.

1bckz5x,Confused about everything,"Hi all. I'd like to learn more about this situation. I have some questions. I've done a ton of research and spoken to so many people and I'm still a bit confused. I hope I don't offend anyone. I just want to learn whether things I'm reading/being told are true or not.

- How many hostages are there? Where are they? Who started taking hostages first and when did this start? Why did this start?

- I keep getting told the only way for Israel to ceasefire is if Hamas releases the hostages. Does Israel also have hostages still? If so, is the justification to bomb Gaza to find the hostages? And if so, wouldn't that defeat the purpose? Does anyone care about ensuring hostages remain alive and not hurt?

- I'm told Hamas broke the ceasefire Oct 7. Why did they break the ceasefire? Did Israel do something to cause them to break it? If so, what?

- I might lose some people here, please help me understand. Do Muslims and Jews want each other dead? Why? Is it in the religion to show no mercy to Jews? Or is that propaganda?

- There is talk about who deserves to live on the land considering whoever was there first. Ok, who exactly was there first? And if we go by this logic, I live in America, so where would I go if this land got taken back? I didn't mean to be born here. It's not my fault I'm on this land. So why are children dying? What is the logic here?

- I have been told Palestinians should just move to Egypt. Ok, that's a potential solution, but why should they move and not Israelis? What is the argument here? 

- Hamas is a resistance group, considered a terrorist organization. Palestinian Authority won the popular vote and got them in power, not Palestinians. Ok, got it. People tell me ""Think about why they exist because it's not for no reason."" Alright, so if they won the popular vote, are they the ones blocking aid from going into Gaza? If so, why? And why are people mad about Hamas existing to defend Gazans if the Israeli army is doing the same thing? 

- Zionism. It gives me an icky feeling. Although I respect the right to self determination. Do zionists not care about who dies in order for there to be a Jewish state? I've been told Jewish Voice for Peace doesn't represent all Jewish people. Okay, but do some Jewish people disagree with this organization because they want all Palestinians dead and JVP doesn't?

- Anti-semitism. I'll keep this one short. Aren't Palestinians also considered semites? And if so, aren't we witnessing anti-Semitism on both sides then?

- From the river to the sea. Does this have genocidal connotation to it? Is this saying wipe out Israel? What exactly does this mean? 

I just want facts. I don't want fighting. I know some people say ""wars are violent, that's just the way it is."" Wasn't all of this preventable? 

Also, is Hamas actually trying to defend Gazans? Or no?

Thanks in advance.

17okl8w,"Moderation update Nov 5, 2023","Another moderation update to keep people informed.

As we mentioned we well over doubled our user base and are still growing at a fast clip (though it has fallen off soon).  New users take a lot more effort than more regular users.  Volumes were about 6x what the mod team could handle.  We are now slightly above 2x.  This is  better but not better enough.  Let me elaborate a bit.

10/7 was the first successful invasion of Greenline Israel since 1949. The first battle Israelis lost since 1973. Right after 10/7 we had a lot of posts and comments by BDSers mocking Israelis for their dead and many of the moderators in early stages of grief and shock.  While 1/2 the team is still pretty agitated the grief is less fresh so at least emotionally things are better for the moderation team. Hamas is doing terribly in the war so far, there isn't much excitement on the ground.  So we are back to the more normative tone of: *Israel does X, is X justified or not* type debate.  

In terms of news coverage.  Normally during these crisis volumes drop off quickly.  That didn't happen this time because the story keeps evolving:   
1.  Details of Hamas' attack
2.  The initial bombing campaign
3.  Discussion of would there be a ground invasion
4.  The possibility of regional escalation and the whole USA/Iran war threats
4.  The initial stages of the ground invasion
5.  The various politics especially for the Biden administration as the Israel-Gazan War is a wedge issue for Democrats. 

I do think that Biden stabilizes policies and volume of news stories which feed sub volume for new users will  probably will let up later in the week. Of course it is Republican interests to keep this story in the news so (6) may or may not phase out.  
What worries me in terms of volume (just talking about the sub not the participants). 

Two things are likely to keep volumes higher than normal however.

1.  Lots of ground troops in Gaza.  Creating a drain on Israel's economy.  Israel is forced to act and act fast since unlike the USA they do not have a professional army.  We should expect more activity. 

2. Gaza teetering on the edge of a humanitarian crisis. Various 3rd parties are very worried about trying to avoid this.  And of course if Gaza falls over the edge from teetering, volumes will skyrocket again possibly to the highest levels we seen.  

OK so enough about volumes.  Now the question what are we doing about it.  

Most important thing is an urgent appeal for mods. If you are a mod and taking it easy see if you can help more than you have been.  If you are a regular here please volunteer.  If you are experienced at other large subs and willing to mod volunteer.  If you know the issue well and can show any other social media evidence volunteer. To volunteer just reply to this post.  

If you are totally new to Reddit but would like to mod, we aren't going to promote you immediate to mod.  But if you start reminding people of rules violations on a voluntary basis we will promote you.  Please be careful about rule 4 warnings to keep them narrow and not violate rule 1 yourself.  Be gentle with reminders about rules. 

In terms of users.  We simply can't handle the volume of rule breaking and troublemaking users.  We are continuing the policy of banning more aggressively.  Our normal is violation(s) ->  warnings ->  repeat violation -> ban.  Under increased load **warnings remain optional**.     Normal ban cycle is 4-30-life.  We are doing 4-30-90-life.  Ban lengths more likely to repeat.  So **please read the rules**.  Appeals do remain open.  Ban quality has dropped.  

In terms of bias we had a karma script which was helping ease the load but was biasing moderation (see https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17842nj/gaza_war_moderation_update_oct_14_2023/).  That got disabled about 10 days ago.  Which I'm happy about.  I want moderation to be as unbiased as humanely possible. 

The policy about lying about IDF safety warnings (see post from Oct 14th linked above) remains in effect but the warning in that post appears to have caused all these to disappear.  For example the IDF a security corridor today and we haven't had disinformation posted.  So hopefully one problem that won't repeat.  

Finally we intend to modify the automod script to simply remove for short length. Which means **short good faith questions** will get caught.  Please make your questions meet the 3 paragraph minimum for now.  Remember 3 sentences with line breaks is not what we mean by 3 paragraphs. 

This is a metapost allowed thread.  This is the right place to discuss policy concerns.  There is much to discuss feel free to ask questions or make comments.",05/11/23 20:14:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17okl8w/moderation_update_nov_5_2023/,28,177,801,Oct 7,top,all
1b3ir7s,Are there two groups within the Pro-Palestinian Movement? ,"
2 groups within Pro-Palestine movement?

I’ll preface this by saying that I am a Jew, who has recently lived in Israel (jan - June of 2023) and has been bombed whilst living there and lived through 2 terror attacks in my city. (Car ramming on tel aviv beach and shooting in tel aviv mall) . 

I keep seeing people [advocate for a global intifada](https://nypost.com/2023/11/17/metro/pro-palestinian-protesters-shout-long-live-the-intifada-in-union-square/amp/) (long live the intifada) but also see people advocate for ceasefire. Intifada literally translates to “uprising” and refers to an intense Palestinian uprising against Israelis. Jews see calls for intifada as aggression towards Jews and a call for the death of Jews (ie Oct 7)

Are the groups that are pro-ceasefire and pro-intifada seperate? Are they vouching for different goals? Or same goal through opposing means?
Or are the pro Palestinians unknowingly advocating for two opposite ideas (I assume this would be primarily Caucasian supporters who do not know the history or meaning of “intifada”)

I’m not sure how anyone, Palestinian or Israeli, can vouch for an intifada given that the most recent (Second Intifada) [resulted in the death of 5000 Palestinians and 1400 Israelis](https://www.britannica.com/topic/intifada) Referring to my earlier story about the [car ramming](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67983624.amp) and [shooting](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-raid-death-arrest-settlers-otzma-1159122477ab4a3c6607ff16da10acab)  - are these examples of intifada? An intifada is in line with the acts of October 7 and is antithesis to a ceasefire. These two groups must be opposing within the pro-Palestinian cause, right?

I also would love to know what happens in the case of a “global intifada” - which seems to a be a phrase I am reading around the internet recently. Does that manifest in the form of protest like we are seeing around the world now?

I guess I’m looking for a pro-Palestine supporters view on this topic. Is my definition of an intifada incorrect? Perhaps intifada is also used to describe a peaceful uprising that can exist alongside a ceasefire - but that doesn’t seem right.

17traqb,For The People in Denial of the 10/7/23 Hamas Attack,"The Hamas attack on Israel was October 7, 2023.

17g73at,Poster of Israeli child hostages defaced with ‘Hitler moustaches’,"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/10/25/israel-hostages-defaced-finchley-hitler-moustaches-hamas/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/10/25/israel-hostages-defaced-finchley-hitler-moustaches-hamas/)

&#x200B;

Posters of kidnapped Israeli children have been defaced in north London with police treating the incident as a hate crime.  
  
Images appealing for the return of two three-year-olds, Emma and Yuli Cunio, were vandalised with Hitler-like moustaches drawn onto the children’s faces.  
  
Footage has also emerged of pro-Palestinian supporters tearing down hostage posters in Leicester Square, with one woman seen smiling at onlookers as she walks away from the scene.  
  
The posters were put up as part of efforts to raise awareness of the plight of over 200 people currently being kept hostage by Hamas in Gaza.  
  
One of the posters in South Hampstead features the smiling twin girls, who were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct 7.  
  
Two moustaches reminiscent of Adolf Hitler’s were drawn over the faces of Emma and Yuli on a poster that was placed at a Finchley Road bus stop.  
  
  
The twins’ parents, Sharon and David Cunio were also abducted alongside Sharon’s sister, Danielle Alony, 44, and her five-year-old daughter Emilia.  
  
When Hamas gunmen entered the kibbutz, the family fled to a safe room.  
  
Several hours later, terrorists burst through the front door of the family home.  
  
  
Six days later their family were informed that they were among the hostages.  
  
Among the defaced posters was also one with an image of Tomer Eliaz Arava, who is now understood to have been killed during the massacres.  
It has previously been reported that Tomer, 17, was ordered by terrorists to go door-to-door at the Nahal Oz kibbutz, near the southern border of Israel and Gaza, and tell its residents in Hebrew that it was “safe to open the door”.  
  
Footage filmed in Leicester Square showed two women and a man ripping down similar posters.  
  
In the video, one of the women, wearing a black coat and a long scarf, is told the posters show “photos of people kidnapped by terrorists” and is accused of not caring about “human life”.  
  
‘We fully understand the distress’  
The Metropolitan Police said it was aware of the vandalism on Finchley Road, which it described as appalling, adding it was investigating the incidents as possible hate crimes.  
  
A spokesman added: “Police have been made aware of a number of photos that have been posted on social media today of posters which have been defaced in the Finchley Road area.  
  
“We fully understand the distress this will cause to local communities. Police are investigating the incident and are treating it as a hate crime.”  
  
The incident in Leicester Square is not currently being treated as a crime, but officers are “in the area carrying out reassurance patrols”.  
  
The ‘lowest of the low’  
The Israeli Embassy condemned the incidents and urged the UK to “uphold values of tolerance and decency”.  
  
It added: “Defacing images of kidnapped Israeli children with Hitler moustaches is profoundly anti-Semitic, evoking chilling echoes of the Holocaust.”  
  
Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, also criticised the “odious people ripping down posters of missing children” as she said part of the UK’s social contract has been “breached”.  
  
Ms Badenoch told the Commons: “In particular, I believe that the hostility directed towards our Jewish communities, the calls for jihad, the ostentatious indifference to the victims of terrorism, the aggressive chanting by mobs brandishing placards of hate, and the odious people ripping down posters of missing children, do not reflect our values as a nation.”  
  
The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism described the vandalism as the “lowest of the low”.

182xncq,Oct 7 didn't happen in a vacuum. But the plight of the Palestinians didn't happen in a vacuum either,"I keep seeing people argue that October 7 didn't happen in a vaccum, which is a roundabout way to say that the living conditions of the Palestinians inevitably led to conditions which resulted in Oct 7. In other words, Palestinians have no agency and this is all traced back to the occupation.

But if we are told to look at the context of Oct 7 more broadly, we also need to look at the current Palestinian condition more broadly. Lets zoom all the way out. So sure - Oct 7 didnt happen in a vaccum, but the reason why Paestinians still dont have a country and are under occupation in the first place didn't happen in a vacuum either. 

The Palestinian fight for statehood began in the 1960s, before Israel even came in control of the west bank and Gaza, which arguably speaks volumes. Further, Israel, upon taking control of Gaza and West Bank offered to give it all back in exchange for peace.

The response? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum\_Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum_Resolution)

Arabs came back and issued the 3 No's:

No peace with Israel,  
No negotiation with Israel,  
No recognition of Israel

So now Israel is stuck with lands it doesnt want. It offers to give it back for peace and is rebuffed. Subsequent offers of peace were also rebuffed because Palestinians expect all of their demands to be met, no matter how unrealistic or fantastical. 

Meanwhile, Palestinians in recent years have received more international aid than any other group in history, but the money has only made the leaders rich as Palestinians live in poverty.

So while October 7 didnt happen in a vacuum, the current occupation and the reason why Palestinians dont have a country also didn't happen in a vacuum.",24/11/23 17:46:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/182xncq/oct_7_didnt_happen_in_a_vacuum_but_the_plight_of/,25,28,288,Oct 7,top,all
1b7tf7d,"so if Israel is toppled will the ""humanitarians"" care?","So with people saying block resources to is and stop government interference; what do you think will happen?  I agree Israel is at fault for being overly dependent on us for many years; though Hamas and Hezbollah are given arms by Iran. so should the people who want to kill citizens be given weapons but those who want their country not to be destroyed be armless?

Then I mean you get one thing Palestine won't be attacked; yay. then what a hero from Palestine gives a 5-minute speech about understanding this makes Hamas stop attacking and Hezbollah? why cant people from places like us, Britain and Germany understand the Middle East (most of it) is different? many countries have governments that are more fitting of a terrorist title.

these groups are bloodthirsty psychopaths( most of them, government not country) who will chuck a baby in front of a moving tank to aid that thing going the extra mile. they don't care about there citizens they love martyrism and have a mentality similar to that of ants.

Here's the thing most younger people don't understand, older people have seen history and what these people do. they know their true colors. The UN is made up of fascists who aid Hamas; they don't speak for the people. they support Unra an organization that made television like far four.

If they win they will go to is. they will repeat Oct 7 all over the country without remorse. just like past generations tried. again in 2006 and aiding Hitler in destroying Israel. If Israel listens to these peace talks that's what's going to happen. no one wants a war, most even in is want ps independence but now they have turned to clear terrorists and are using themselves as scapegoats for bad pr.

ps are the ones who always talked about martyrs and needing to destroy Israel. I am sorry for numerous operations that have not been executed perfectly to stop innocents from dying but people have been hurt going to extreme measures. the media wants you to think ps is this deprived land never had a chance. and that Israel just fires bombs willy-nilly.

Soldiers have gone door to door, there have been incidents of citizens throwing rocks and openly assaulting soldiers, and there are suicidal children and adults as martyrs. Hamas soldiers are dressing in civilian clothing, hiding underneath buildings shooting rockets, and supporting this martyrish process making snap-second decisions critical.

It doesn't even affect me anymore. I realize our people will always be seen as disposable and I don't know if future generations will vote to embrace terrorism to sound tolerant. I guess Im happy partially to live outside is but all I know is everyone focuses on what is does and not the facts that in every direction there's war not to protect anyone or stop a war but to exterminate but hey bad guys are bad so why care about it. people are playing to Hamas's arms. Its a good thing that the masses don't matter only those in power for however long Jews live.

If you don't think you cheering do to a political group think ask yourself this. why is it that in arab wars where triple the amount of people die, no one talks about it?",06/03/24 07:01:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1b7tf7d/so_if_israel_is_toppled_will_the_humanitarians/,27,204,551,Oct 7,top,all
17dseki,"Antisemitic, Islamophobic offenses soar in London after Israel attacks","Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called the rise in antisemitism sickening and vowed that Britain would not tolerate any hatred, as groups which monitor incidents involving Jews and Muslims said cases had soared after Hamas gunmen rampaged through Israeli towns and Israel pounded Gaza in response.  
Police in the British capital ramped up patrols amid growing tensions, but said there had been 218 antisemitic offences between Oct. 1 and 18, compared to 15 in the same period in 2022. Islamophobic offences were up to 101, from 42.  
""Regrettably, despite the increased presence of officers we have seen a significant increase in hate crime across London,"" police said in a statement.  
""This includes abuse directed at individuals or groups in person or online, racially or religiously motivated criminal damage and other offences.""

Officers have made 21 arrests for hate crime offences, including a man detained for defacing posters of missing Israelis and another over Islamophobic graffiti on bus stops.

Palestinians: What do you think of suicide bombers?

What are your thoughts on these videos? There is no two-state solution. Hamas does not care about the Palestinian people. How do you negotiate with terrorists who use their own children as human shields? What type of coward hides behind innocent civilians and then uses it as propaganda when civilians inevitably get killed. The sole intention of the Oct 7th terrorist attack was to kill as many Jews as possible. There was zero intention of peace involved. Why are people calling for a “ceasefire”? That only gives Hamas more time to prepare for the next terrorist attack. How can the world sit and accuse Israel of “apartheid”, “genocide”, “ethnic cleansing”? Throwing around such inflammatory claims when that is exactly what Hamas wants to do to the Jews. It says so in their own Charter…

According to a statement by the Israel Defense Forces, the airstrike at the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza targeted and killed Ibrahim Biari, whom it described as one of the Hamas commanders responsible for the October 7 attack on Israel, which left than 1,400 people dead and hundreds taken hostage.",01/11/23 15:56:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17lfb64/hamas_official_ghazi_hamad_we_will_repeat_the/,28,57,222,Oct 7,top,all
177q3sl,A survivor's recount of the events,"I'll start by saying that it's often easy to block emotion or ignore posts like these when you empathize with the other side (Palestine) as the first thing that comes to mind is that the post is likely biased and therefore may contain false information, so why bother reading it?

My personal opinion is that we must strive to find the objective truth (read between the lines, filter out fake news, etc.) and most importantly stand in solidarity with civilians on both sides and stand against all radicals who wish to inflict terror and/or kill others for their beliefs, race, sexuality, etc. 

 

A friend of my family was a bouncer at the rave party on Oct 7.

19bynva,What does Israeli left wing thinks of Nethanyahu rejection of the 2 state solution? Yossi Beilin,"We have seen or heard Israeli right wing/ far-right wing politicians and leaders making public statement and left many in the west dumbfounded, did they just said what I think they said. Pro-Israel supporters in the west will go… why did you have to say that ? How am I going to defend Israel in the upcoming tiktok battle ? Pro-Palestinian supporters in the west will go… ahha gotcha…time to create some tiktok reels and prepare to win the next tiktok battle. 

What about the Israeli left wing opposition ? What do they think about what’s Nethanyahu said recently ? Yossi Beilin is a former Israeli minister, left wing, retired. Nethanyahu is from right wing and is in a coaltion with far right wing politicians which many people are quite familiar with like Ben-Gvir, Avi Dichter, Bezalel Smotrich etc… Yossi Beilin’s party has not been very popular recently, not many seats in the Knesset.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ac8S98LoU Yossi Beilin on LBC (UK)

You will realize this conversation with a left wing Israeli politician (retired) is very calm and civil. Nobody is raising their voice, banging on the desk or slinging accusations at each other. It’s also very insightful, his analysis, reading and thinking is very different from what most western media and their so-called Middle East expert policy would want their audience to believe. 

1. Nethanyahu is on the way out. Personally, Nethanyahu doesn’t believe in the two state solution. Nethanyahu did in the past officially supported two state solution, but has since renegaded on it

2. Nethanyahu wants to stay in power. He needs the support of far-right wing politicians to continue leading this government. Like all politicians, they just say what is needed to be said to get support/votes (i.e. continued support from far-right coalition partners). Don’t take what Nethanyahu said too seriously. It’s being blown out of proportion in the international media.

3. We don’t have another better solution than the two state solution for the Arabs, for the Israelis and for this region. It is the only solution. Nethanyahu did not put an end to the two state solution.

4. The horrific events of Oct 7th doesn’t erase the need for a solution. It is true, there is alot of hatred at this moment, these emotions and feeling will pass in time.

5. If Nethanyahu gives up on his far-right partners and said I agree to a demilitarized Palestinian state, let’s enter negotiations with the PLO. If he said that, the centrist parties in the opposition will support him. He could be Mr Peacemaker as his legacy. He has the backing of the world and the US President to push for peace and a two state solution.  

6. We are not going to the supermarket to choose who to negotiate to. PLO is the only legitimate representative, recognized by many countries. Mahmoud Abbas is a man of peace. He wants peace. We can talk with him. People criticize Mahmoud Abbas. But none of the other Arab leaders in the world are very popular and has the support of their people. No Arab state is fully democratic.

7. Nethanyahu’s current approval rating is only 18%. Nethanyahu doesnt speak for all Israelis.

I hope this will give some hope to people in the west who thought Israel has rejected the two state solution. Netanyahu told Biden in private phone call he was not foreclosing the possibility of a Palestinian state in any form https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/19/politics/joe-biden-benjamin-netanyahu-palestinian-state/index.html. If Nethanyahu cant deliver a solution, perhaps a future Israeli leader, after Nethanyahu could deliver a two-state solution.

I wonder if its easier to get the far-right wing parties to ditch Nethanyahu, rather than Nethanyahu to ditch them. Let the Nethanyahu government fall, then call for new elections. Hopefully Israe’s new government wouldn’t be filled  far right wings cabinet ministers constantly making inflamatory and questionable statements.

19e27dp,The lack of any realistic concern or thought of Israeli as,"Let me get this straight, on Oct 6–> peace. On Oct 7–> Gaza’s military initiated a land invasion murdered raped and took hostage As many people as possible without concern (as opposed to idf having to deal with gazas human shield issue resulting in collateral). If the iron dome or idf didn’t come (and yes they came late) it would have been complete genocide of Israeli people. Then in Gaza the streets are celebrating this and Gazas government approval shot up a lot after raping and killing. If gazans protested against Hamas for release of hostages yes but at this point, the Hamas/UN run education system led to anti semitism ingrained in the young generations who have been taught selective history without context . UNRWA school have more or less been an Arabic hitlers youth. 

 I think people are insane in thinking the Israeli people should be expected to want an independent Palestinian state. Maybe before but now there is no trust that independent statehood wouldn’t leak to more rapw and death. You are not going to allow people who promote death and rape of Israel> peace to self govern. If so, Hamas will survive and regroup due to the antisemitism education ingrained in gazans (and West Bank education is really antisemitic too). 

The reality is, Israel has reached an understanding—> Palestinians cannot currently govern themselves and will likely be unable to for 20ish years. Their upbringing currently makes them unable to live in peace with Jews and will perpetual attempt to destroy Jews unless a major education overall occurs without the anti semitic un or Palestinian run school systems and Palestinians are under security control to ensure Hamas or Hamas like groups won’t be able to amass.

Director of the Al-Haq Institute for Human Rights Sha’awan Jabarin: “A topic [that] still isn’t clear… is the matter of those who entered [Israel] on [Oct.] 7 from the Gaza Strip – civilians, fighters (i.e., Hamas terrorist murderers), and others – and how [the Israelis] behaved towards them.

17skvdx,40 Journalists have been killed since Oct 7,"
The Committee to Project Journalists says that 40 journalists have been killed so far in this war since Oct 7, making this by far the deadliest conflict for journalists in the past 30 years!!

Here is a link to an interactive map of the journalists who have been killed to date:

https://cpj.org/full-coverage-israel-gaza-war/#interactive-map

To add some perspective, in all of 2022, there were 67 journalists killed across all conflicts in the world.

Either journalists are being targeted or Israel is failing in their stated mission of “doing everything they can to avoid civilian casualties.”   And by failing I mean doing far worse than any other conflict in the past 30 years at avoiding civilian casualties.   The IDF is either incompetent or they are not really trying to avoid civilian casualties.",11/11/23 02:41:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17skvdx/40_journalists_have_been_killed_since_oct_7/,26,308,129,Oct 7,top,all
18ltynq,International Criminal Court investigation on war crimes in Israel & Palestine,"There are a lot of accusations and discussions about war crimes related to the situation in Gaza & the West Bank. Are war crimes being committed? How do we know?

War crimes and other crimes against humanity such as genocide are investigated and tried by the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. The Prosecutor has been investigating the situation in the State of Palestine since [March 2021](https://www.icc-cpi.int/palestine), so this isn’t a new investigation, but it has taken on a new urgency since the Oct. 7 attacks.

Initially, the case was opened to investigate Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, which Palestinians argue is in breach of Geneva conventions. Human rights groups further claim that Israel is committing the crime of apartheid in the occupied territories.

Why does the process take so long?

Before opening the investigation, the Prosecutor had to conduct a preliminary assessment to determine if the statutory criteria had been met and there was sufficient information to believe war crimes were or are being committed. The Court determined [there is](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/31/have-war-crimes-been-committed-in-israel-and-gaza-and-what-international-laws-apply).

Then the Court had to determine if it has jurisdiction, and that its jurisdiction extends to Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The Court determined that it did and opened the investigation despite objections from Israel and the US. Israel tried to argue that it’s not subject to the ICC’s authority because it did not sign the Rome statute that established the court, and the US backed Israel’s position, but the Court moved forward.

Another impediment to the investigation is that Israel has [refused to cooperate](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56687437.amp) with the Court and blocked ICC investigators from traveling to Israel or the occupied Palestinian territories. Both the US and Israel have taken actions in the past to impede the investigation, but the ICC says it’s determined to pursue it and followed up by cond[ucting the first visit to Israel and the State of Palestine by an ICC](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-khan-kc-ramallah-situation-state-palestine-and-israel) prosecutor on Dec. 2, 2023.

During the Prosecutor’s visit, he affirmed his commitment to investigate war crimes committed against both Israelis & Palestinians, including Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks and Israel’s military response in Gaza.

Netanyahu will likely continue to [denounce the investigation as “pure anti-Semitism](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-an-icc-investigation-of-israel-would-be-pure-anti-semitism/amp/)” as he’s done in the past, and the US may keep trying to enable him, but it will be more difficult with international attention on Gaza. So far, five countries have submitted a referral to the Court to ask for this to be investigated: South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros & Djibouti.

Lastly, earlier this year, Biden ordered the US government to start sharing information with the ICC’s investigation into atrocities committed in Ukraine. It would be a bad look for him to undermine the investigation in Gaza while cooperating in Ukraine, especially with the upcoming election.",19/12/23 05:11:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18ltynq/international_criminal_court_investigation_on_war/,23,68,470,Oct 7,top,all

moualg,Al-Husseini really was a Nazi ally. I’m troubled.,"This week there was some discussion this week on this sub, in another thread, about a recent rare historical photo that was auctioned off that showed Palestinian Arab nationalist and exiled leader Grand Mufti Hajj Amin al-Husseini touring a concentration camp. 

Personally, I’ve always played down the “Nazi connection” stuff, reasoning that there’s plenty more significant material in his documented political activities as Arab leader during the Mandate and that, in kind of a Godwin’s Law approach, just pasting on the Nazi label would trivialize a serious discussion of what the man did in Palestine, for better or worse, or at least getting an understanding of the more militant Arab views on Jews during the Mandate and after. I could just chalk up his fleeing to Berlin during WWII as kind of an “enemy of my enemies” kind of thing from a man who certainly would have been interned or imprisoned by the British if he set foot back in Palestine. 

Now, after reading [this article in Tablet discussing the infamous photograph](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/amin-al-husseini-nazi-concentration-camp) I’m really not so sure anymore about the Nazi label and whether it should be regarded as historically significant.

Some excerpts below from the Tablet article author, the German historian Wolfgang D. Schwanitz, put this photo of a concentration camp visit in a more disturbing context:

> The mufti arrived at Bellevue Palace in Berlin on Nov. 6 and met with Bose. Both agreed on propaganda maneuvers. Al-Husseini used the next 22 days until his meeting with Hitler to solicit from Nazi leaders two commitments: The end of legal travel by Jews to the Middle East (Himmler ordered it on Oct. 23, both Arabs having demanded this again on Sept. 24 in their 11 points) and the destruction of the Jewish homeland in Palestine.

> To build consensus for his ambitions within the Nazi state, the mufti consulted German and Italian envoys in Vichy and Rome on such points as Syria, the Arab Legion, and an Axis declaration on Arabia. On Nov. 20, Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop told him that Palestine was “purely Arab” and met him twice more: before talking to Hitler and the following day, when he likewise received Bose. Alluding to the looming Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor, the foreign minister told the Indian that Japan and America would soon experience a state of conflict that could lead to war.

...

> The mufti’s meetings over his 22 days in Berlin centered around debates about the Arabia declaration by Berlin and Rome, which his secretary Uthman Kamal Haddad took down and handed over to Grobba on Feb. 25, 1941. This declaration had been maturing since mid-1940. Its clause 7 stipulated that Berlin and Rome would declare a Jewish homeland in Palestine illegal. Furthermore, they would recognize the right of Arabs, including those in Palestine, to solve the question of Jewish populations there “in the Arab national interest and in the same manner as the question has been resolved in the Axis countries.” Rademacher’s text stipulated that Jews be deported to Eastern Europe; it mentions nothing about the Middle East, although immigration had previously been Hitler’s preferred course of action: The Haavara pact of 1933 allowed for about 60,000 German Jews to emigrate to Palestine, up until 1939.

...

> Al-Kailani’s military agreement with Berlin provided that the Axis military occupation would be replaced by a civilian government after six months—and it is clear what Iraq’s Jews would have faced in those six months. Meanwhile, Berlin and Rome honed their Arabia declaration up until Hitler received the mufti.

> The two men met for 95 minutes on Friday, Nov. 28. In that meeting, Hitler revealed to al-Husseini his plan to kill Jews in Europe, the Middle East and globally, and his desire to invade Iraq and Iran. His guest was to wait until Nazi troops reached the southern point of departure from the Caucasus. Von Ribbentrop had already planned the Tbilisi moment, when the Nazis reached the Middle East and India via the Suez Canal and/or the Caucasus via this Georgian city. From there, the Arabs and Bose were to call for revolts “from Jerusalem via Baghdad to Calcutta,” form governments in exile, and then proceed homeward with the Nazis.

> Al-Husseini agreed with Hitler and awaited his order. Their genocidal pact was a further marker in the spiral of wartime escalations against Jews that intensified on Jan. 30, 1939, when Hitler threatened before the Reichstag that a new world war would be followed by “the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe”—a threat he repeated again in a public speech at the end of January 1941 in Berlin. To al-Husseini he went further, promising him the annihilation of the Jews of the Middle East and globally. Because of Japan’s approaching attack on Pearl Harbor 10 days later, which Hitler had learned of in advance, the subject of total world war came up. Hitler now wanted to realize plans far beyond the German Reich.

> When the mufti left, Hitler laid down four points with von Ribbentrop. He put on hold the Arabia declaration, which he discussed with Mussolini. It was not until 12 days later that the short text, complete with photos and film, arrived without the date of the meeting: Hitler’s adjutant’s office did not release the text until Dec. 9, 1941, and the press reported it the following day, again without a date, the delay serving to obscure the specific context to Hitler’s meeting with al-Husseini. Hitler also planned to install an Arab Islamic leadership council in Berlin that would agree to his reordering of the Middle East.

...

I’m now willing to give al-Husseini less of a benefit of the doubt. If what this historian said is  an accurate description of the diplomatic maneuvering that explains those photographs, and that al-Husseini really was being given inside information about the plans for the Holocaust and an invitation to do that in Palestine if the Axis prevailed in war is beyond disturbing. 

I’m still conflicted about the Nazi label used as a smear, like when people claim folks on the Jewish side like Meir Stern tried to work some deal with Gobbels about trucks for immigration permits or saying that Jabotinsky was a fascist because he was a militant who organized uniformed youth movements like Betar. 

But it’s clear to me that Husseini did far worse stuff and had a far worse intent than just flee to Berlin in exile and broadcast propaganda on short wave radio. He clearly was a serious Nazi ally who could have caused a Holocaust in Palestine had Rommel not been stopped by the Allies. 

Does this make a difference to the narrative? Should it? Discuss.",11/04/21 16:48:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/moualg/alhusseini_really_was_a_nazi_ally_im_troubled/,22,17,1117,Oct 7,top,all
18kacla,Why people say Gaza has no resources instead of Gazan government intentionallymisallocates resources,"Why does the international community call on Israel > Gazan Government (HAMAS) for aid. I also think just putting Hamas as a terrorist group underscores the evil its committing. It's also the Gazan government, the one entrusted with leading its people, purposely using them to benefit themselves (the leaders, not the civilians) and destroy Israel.  
?All over UN, liberal media, its the same, ""How evil is israel for not letting fuel into gaza!"" (as if there isn't a war going on, trading fuel for hostages is a pretty fair bargain.  
Aid for hostages. That is a fair bargain. And if the Gazan government is not willing to accept that, then why is the innternational community and liberals not holding Hamas to the fire. The gazan government prioritizes having Israeli hostages > fuel, food etc for its people.  
I think the issue is there is a stanch difference between not having resources vs not allocating resources. Tunnels need innervation to send oxygen/lights, particularly down. That requires fuel, and likely lots. The military allegedly has food for a while. Gaza has fuel and income, but it allocates it to war tunnels > hosptials. That is not the same as not having aid. Furthermore, it would be in such reason israel has genuine concern the fuel it allow into Gaza would then be used by the Gazan government to destroy Israel.  
And yet, despite the citizens of gaza being starved, Gaza has rockets, lots of them, and their leaders are still affording thier Qatar billionaire lifestyleS. This may shock some people, maybe a lot, but ROCKETS are not cheap. 300+ miles of tunnels and the innervation to keep them are not cheap. And also, hamas' top leaders are also billionaires.  
Like, where is the UN outrage over that? Where are liberal outrage at hamas prioritizing fueling the tunnels > hospitals? Where is the outrage at refusing to release all hostages so israel will open the border for aid since 1) The aid crisis is in all large due to misallocation and 2) You are not getting aid due to keeping hostages.  
When Oct. 7 occured, where was the UN resolution for immediate hostage release and hamas surrender? Where was the UN resolution everytime hamas took fuel for its tunnels? Where was the resolution when a country is strapped for resources when its leaders are EACH billionaires? Where is the resolution that when money is sent that could be used for infastructure to help gazans its instead allocated to tunnels, rockets, and its leaders Qatar lifestyle?

18l86er,Biden says Israel is bombing Gaza indiscriminately,"Quote: ""They’re starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place"". This is strong statement from the Us president who is Israel's biggest ally. The US voted against the ceasefire resolution in the security council and Biden has been a life long supporter of Israel. What do you think of this statement? Biden is pretty much saying Israel is targeting civilians, you can't really accuse him of being pro Hamas. Israel is slowly loosing support from it's allies because even they undrestand that the war on Gaza is pretty much turning into an anti Arab revenge campaign with an incredibly high cost of civilian human lives. Israel isn't winning this war , after over 2 months and 20k deaths in Gaza Hamas is still able to operate, the IDF isn't even close to eliminating Hamas and the war will likely continue for many other months. Even Israel's allies realize that the civilian death toll is just unacceptable, if the war continues we could be seeing 50k deaths in the next few months, the complete destruction of Gaza which will make the area pretty much uninhabitable. There are also legitimate concerns that Israel may occupy Gaza indefinitely and expel part of the population which means ethnic cleansing even Netanyahu says he doesn't want to rule Gaza that's the only likely option after the war.
I believe Biden statements are very important, pro Israeli have been accusing the other side of being pro Hamas and anti Jewish just because of the nere suggestion that Israel is targeting civilians and bombing Gaza indiscriminately

Early on they had mostly no opinions on Jews though you can find quotes like  Sinn Féin organiser Seamus MacManus, ""all the editors [of American newspapers were] pro-British and anti-French largely because of the Dreyfus affair … Several of these editors were Jews … Many of the papers were under the thumbs of the Jews financially"".   ​In the 1920s they were more divided.  Éamon de Valera went back and forth on the question of whether one could be Irish and Jewish.  Arthur Griffith while claiming not to be an antisemite did think that Jews should be persecuted since it was in society's interest to protect the weak from the evil Jews, ""what is known as Anti-Semitism on the Continent had its origin … in a very natural detestation of business knavery, and a very natural desire to defend the weak against the unscrupulous"".  Others felt that as Ireland was a Catholic country Jews shouldn't be welcomed but that merely makes them, ""more Zionist than anti-Semite"", since  ""Israel represents the triumph of Sinn Fein"" (this was said before formal independence). 

Since  1967 Sinn Fein not been mixed, they are openly pro-PLO.  Ireland's official position according to Sinn Fein should involve some combination of anti-Jewish incitement, bad / no trade relations with Israel and possibly other actions designed to weaken Israel so that the Palestinians can triumph.  For example there are widespread calls in Ireland to expel the Israeli ambassador, an act just short of a declaration of war.  This with no allegation he's failed in his duties, they just don't like Israeli policy. A violation of the Vienna convention in the name of protesting against violations of International Law ironically.  To put it bluntly, in Sinn Finn's view Ireland's relationship with Israel should be a lot like Iran's. 

In practice though it is hard to figure out what Sinn Fein actually wants.  A lot of Irish people do seem to want to play a constructive role in the conflict viewing their Northern Ireland conflict's resolution as a path for Israel/Palestine.  Since Ireland, despite Sinn Fein rhetoric, is unlikely to step up to the plate and challenge Israel the way Iran has, the most likely consequence of a Sinn Fein government is that: Israel just classifies Ireland's government as a rhetorical enemy, ignores it and dialogues mostly with parties out of power.  Much like what happened with countries like Brazil and Venezuela when they went down this path.  [John Brady](https://www.sinnfein.ie/john-brady) is Sinn Fein's foreign affairs spokesperson.  His official position is that Israel is an apartheid, imperialist state that is irredeemable and that The EU and the government must urgently negotiate with Israel to get minor policy concessions.  His official position is that the West Bank is occupied, already de facto annexed and under apartheid.  That the situation in the West Bank is uniquely terrible or that all of Israel is terrible.  That Gaza (removal of settlements) is the desired outcome and that it isn't since it is the place where Israeli oppression is greatest.  You get the point.   

The outcome of little formal contact between Israel and Ireland would be seen as a Sinn Fein failure by the Irish people.   However, Sinn Fein is a member of BDS.  Breaking with BDS would be seen as a betrayal by the Irish people.  Here the problem is not Sinn Finn it is the Irish themselves.  Degrading official contacts so that Ireland has no effectual diplomacy is BDS policy.  That is not understood by the Irish who want more not less effectual diplomacy via. BDS (BDS does aim to recruit the stupid).   This puts Sinn Fein in a bind.  Sinn Fein if/when they assume power is going to suddenly have to deal with actual responsibility.   Just throwing spitballs at Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for trying to play a responsible role and not giving into the general level of thoughtless hatred that exists among the Irish population probably won't work.   

There was an interesting example of this dilemma playing out this week.  There is a British diplomatic group called [Forward Thinking](https://www.forward-thinking.org/).  They are a peace through dialogue group.  In their opinion Oslo ran into trouble because the negotiators didn't talk to groups that rejected Oslo (whether Hamas, Islamic Jihad and PFLP... on the Palestinian side or guys like Bennett on the Israeli side). They believe in engaging with all the various parties as a way to restart mediation, trying to create a new framework that includes the concerns of Oslo's opponents.  Sinn Fein as a believer in a negotiated and not a unilateral peace is a member of Forward Thinking sending an official Sinn Fein diplomatic group to a Forward Thinking event.  They often point to the British being willing to negotiate with Sinn Fein as being critical in getting peace in Northern Ireland so they agree strongly with Forward Thinking's position.    Sinn Fein as a member of BDS believes in boycott, divestment and sanction forcing the Israelis into a unilateral surrender to BDS demands.  BDS believes diplomacy and especially friendship encounters is a huge net negative since it takes place in a structure that speaks of ""conflict"" rather than ""oppressor / oppressed"".  I'll quote Sinn Fein on this: 

>  Sinn Féin will not be meeting any Israeli delegations which may be part of upcoming visits organized by ‘Forward Thinking.’ This position is entirely consistent with Party policy which is mandated at Ard Fheiseanna and is in the public domain. Our last Ard Fheis in 2019 endorsed the following motion: ""This Ard Fheis believes that while the Israeli government employs apartheid policies, oppression and colonization in its occupation of Palestine, Sinn Féin should heed the call from Palestinian civic society to fully support the BDS campaign. This includes not meeting with any Israeli government grouping until requested/supported by Palestinian representatives to do so. ""Our Party policy on the Palestinian struggle is determined by the Sinn Féin membership and is unchanged.  (Declan Kearney MLA Sinn Féin National Chairperson  Oct 13, 2021). 

Now of course BDSers know this is false.  As part of Forward Thinking Sinn Fein leaders including Gerry Adams himself have dialogued with Israeli figures including Likud intellectuals as part of Forward Thinking.   Pat Sheehan defends these meetings, ""Sinn Féin believes that inclusive dialogue between the representatives of the Palestinian and Israeli people is the key to resolving the conflict."" (https://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/41091)

After BDS putting on pressure Sinn Fein officially discontinued these conversations when talking to BDS.  But Forward Thinking claims they are continuing:

> Between 3-7 September 2021, Forward Thinking travelled to Belfast and Dublin. The aim was to reconnect with political, community and religious leaders involved in the pre-, during- and post- conflict resolution processes. The visit also enabled Forward Thinking to plan forthcoming **delegations of Israeli** and Palestinian political and community leaders. Meetings took place with the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, academics, elected leaders and special advisors from the SDLP, **Sinn Fein** and the DUP, former senior Police Officers, ex-combatants from the UVF, and a representative from the Northern Ireland Policing Board (https://www.forward-thinking.org/?p=6338)

Thought this might be worth talking about as an early example of what Ireland's new anti-Israel government will need to navigate.

A recent article that came out, with israel economy stalling to a hard due to the lack of cheap labor that were coming from Gaza and the westbank , the country is granting work visa to Indians to help the economy bounce back. A move that showing India is becoming more closely tied to Israel. 

Im not sure if people were aware of this but India has played a roles in this conflict since Oct 7 and were a factor that initially united the world with Israel and made the attacks on Gaza harsh not fearing reprocussions. Indian state sponsored web accounts spread large amount of misinformation and pro Israel rehotroric.

People now might be asking why would India be so invested in Israel and that's because the Indian Government with Narendra Modi and the BJJ party are in the middle of an attempt to make India a country for Hindus and have been making terrible attempts to making all minorities in India including Muslims a second class. In general India is becoming more authortian and religiously fundamentalist to the expense of the people livint in India. Funnily enough another England created mistake that is still bringing suffering to the people that live there. India supporting Israel is an attempt to make their actions toward Muslims appear more fair and reduce international actions against them

At this point a large chunk of individuals are probably incense with anger and say im being a hypocrite and hamas has links with Iran therefore Putin and therefore its a wash. To this point I would say i support palestinian and not hamas and second is I hold terrible cruel leaders to the same account and dislike all of them. I honestly belive and I would tell this to people that would rant to me that Trump is the worst world leader and I would reply not even close Modi , Putin and netanyahu put him to shame.

Alot of people in this sub-redditt argue the world talks more about this conflict than another and they have a point. Because honestly what Modi and the BJJ group have been doing to India has been a travesty.

Did you all know the largest protest in all of human history happend in 2021 ? This was a protest as Modi implemented policy to reduce the power of Sikhs farmers in India. Which led to the largest protest ever. Interesting to note this attempt by Modi doesn't just target Indian Muslims but anybody that's not a hindu in India.

Honestly India right now reminds me of Israel in the 1970s as there's has been growing trend of Indian led assassination that are targeting political leaders, teachers and activists.  Only recently India was caugt trying to assassinate  a Sikhs leader in Canada and failed. And overall in India these assassination attempts have become so high it become almost a meme such as with Russians throwing people out of balcony or Israel exploding cars to assainate individuals. 

https://apnews.com/article/india-us-sikh-canada-assassination-separatist-leader-a178b912babc8d53d7c87c986623528a

In summary my point isn't that israel needs to disconnect ties with India, that would be silly. But I hate to be a hypocrite I am anti-putin , I am anti-modi, anti xi and I am anti-netanyahu. These nationalistic ties that makes people to not admit to terrible crisis  that are happening shouldn't be tolerated by any person.

18n6am6,"Analysis of Israeli genocidal statements: ""Emphasis on damage, not on accuracy"", Amalek & more.","Already within days of 10/7, Israeli leaders made many chest-beating public statements. Some of those were amplified by concerned voices who perceived these statements to be genocidal in nature. As with everything, it pays to take a closer look and understand the context. It also pays for Israeli leaders to choose their words carefully, as they will be misinterpreted in the worst ways possible.

To be clear, I'm sure that there are some Israelis (hopefully a minority) who would be happy to call for Palestinian genocide. But the following well-beaten quotes are not one of those.

# ""The emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy"":

Sounds like the IDF was announcing that it will officially be committing indiscriminate bombing (a war crime).

The original source I found for this statement is a report from Haaretz in Hebrew, which notably has edited the relevant words, ""הדגש הוא על נזק ולא על דיוק"", out of the original report (compare [this screenshot](https://twitter.com/MacaesBruno/status/1711714461034119377/photo/1), 2nd paragraph line 2, to [the current version](https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2023-10-10/ty-article-live/0000018b-1645-d465-abbb-16f71d060000#1720386730)).

In English language reporting on this statement, The Guardian recently made an important correction to [their article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/10/right-now-it-is-one-day-at-a-time-life-on-israels-frontline-with-gaza) that sheds more light:

>The headline and text of this article were amended on 5 December 2023. An earlier version used a **mistranslated quote** of R Adm Daniel Hagari saying “hundreds of tonnes of bombs” had already been dropped on Gaza and that “the emphasis is on damage and not on accuracy”. In fact, he said “thousands of tonnes of munitions” had been dropped and **“while balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage”**.

*So, what's the difference?* The original mistranslated quote could easily be interpreted as saying ""we don't care about hitting Hamas targets, we care about causing damage in Gaza"". The corrected translation speaks to those who know a thing or two about the laws of war - IHL, that require the acting army to weigh the pros and cons of each strike and methods employed, to balance between military gain vs collateral damage. Within the range of justifiable and legal military responses, there is a choice between minimum acceptable damage to maximum acceptable damage, which directly affects minimum acceptable collateral risk to maximum acceptable collateral risk. In the past, Israel has often focused on surgical strikes, which is on the minimum side of the range. However this time, as Israel faced a bigger threat, the military necessity of a more forceful response was obvious, hence the shift to maximum, but still within IHL.

This understanding fits with [other statements he made](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/11/israel-abandon-precision-bombing-eliminate-hamas-officials/#:~:text=The%20top%20priority%20in%20the%20attacks%20is%20to%20eliminate%20senior%20%5BHamas%5D%20officials) at the same time, ""The top priority in the attacks is to eliminate senior \[Hamas\] officials"", and statements made by IDF officials at that time, ""There are no surgical strikes"" and that ""the concept of 'knock on the roof' is not relevant to this operation"", emphasizing that nevertheless, the strikes are still professional and precise. - [Mako news](https://www.mako.co.il/news-military/6361323ddea5a810/Article-c10c386058d1b81027.htm)

**TLDR:** The original quote is not accurate. The actual quote, translated correctly, is: “while balancing accuracy with the scope of damage, right now we’re focused on what causes maximum damage”. Which means that within the range of legal strikes the IDF can make, they are on the maximum setting, unlike previous Gaza operations, which have been relatively more reserved. It does not mean that the IDF is announcing they will be doing indiscriminate bombing.

# Netanyahu said that ""you must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible.""

# [Israel's Minister of Communications calls on the IDF to remove the foreskins of Hamas fighters as David did in the Tanakh](https://twitter.com/shlomo_karhi/status/1725504217148797065?t=fQCjeexEmpM1ier00jAPIw&s=19)

Again, this is based on bad translation (to be fair, even a native Israeli could misunderstand this). The most obvious flag that the above is a bad interpretation is the fact that Muslims, and by extension Hamas fighters, are already circumcised.

Many words in Hebrew have multiple meanings or can reference different concepts, depending on the context, suffix or prefix. ""Orla"" means a blockage or impediment. When referring to the penis, it means the foreskin. When referring to the heart, it means a spiritual blockage. When referring to produce, it means produce that a Jew is blocked/prohibited from consuming. When referring to the lips, it means a speech impediment (Moses described himself this way ""va'ani aral sefataim""). When referring to a human (""Arel""), it generally means a non-Jew man (or woman - ""Arela"") regardless of the status of their foreskin, as they are not commanded by the Torah to circumcise, or literally an uncircumcised male Jew.

The word in question is in paragraph 3, ערלות, can be read as A) ""orlot"", meaning foreskins of, or B) as ""areloot"", meaning the blockage/impediment of, or C) ""arelot"", meaning non Jewish women. In the context in his tweet, the middle reading fits best, so that sentence should be translated as the following:

>Our fighters, who went to war for the house (homeland) and to avenge the terrible massacre carried out by the Nazi terrorists, will cover them in their tunnels with dirt, and will return to peace with the abductees, with the help of G-d, only after they have cut down **the impediment** of these cursed ones.

1bog8yx,Do Palestinians support Hamas? Evidence from a poll on Palestinian attitudes in Gaza and West Bank,"Extremely long post.

One of the arguments most often invoked against the Palestinians is their supposed wide-spread support for Hamas. As a research scientist, I’m naturally curious – and I’ve been conditioned to never accept a statistic without a source - so I decided to do some digging. I came across a poll conducted by The Palestinian Center of Policy and Research ([https://pcpsr.org/en](https://pcpsr.org/en)), an independent nonprofit organization that has been actively conducting survey research in the Gaza Strip during the Israel-Hamas war. Their most recent poll, published this month, covers Palestinian attitudes on a range of issues relating to the current war.

I want to share the results and my interpretation of the poll with you. My hope is to engage the community in a reasonable and productive discussion without resorting to incendiary rhetoric. I especially encourage contribution from those who have experience in policy research, statistics, or a related field.

The purpose of this post is to provide a brief summary of key finding in a digestible format. I only mention results that I find most interesting and relevant to the current discussion. For complete details on methodology, results, and conclusions: [https://pcpsr.org/en/node/969](https://pcpsr.org/en/node/969)).

I provide the summary first, followed by methodology and results.

**SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION**

**Do Palestinians support Hamas' actions in the current war?**

The results of the March poll show that **more than two thirds (71%) of Palestinians are supportive of Hamas’s decision to launch the October 7 offensive against Israel.** While overall support for the offensive remains unchanged since December, results show an 11 point decline in support in the West Bank (82% to 71%), and a 14 point increase in support in Gaza (57% to 71%). *What could be driving this interaction?* Perhaps for Palestinians in Gaza, living in an active war zone serves as a daily reminder of Israeli aggression, and therefore reaffirms Hamas’ actions on October 7th as justified. For Palestinians living in West Bank, their declining support for Oct 7 may be driven by fear that the war may spill over into the West Bank territory.

Support for October 7 does not necessarily reflect support for Hamas. Currently, the **overall support for Hamas as the party in control of the Gaza Strip sits at 59%**, roughly more than half of all participants. Back in December 2023, only a third of Gazans (38%) preferred Hamas to be in control, compared to 75% of respondents in the West Bank. In March, preference for Hamas saw a 14 point increase in Gaza (52%), and a 9 point decline in the West Bank (64%). *Could the differences between Gaza and West Bank seen here be related to a similar change in attitudes relating to October 7th?*

**Support for Hamas if Palestinians were allowed to participate in presidential and parliamentary elections**

When asked who their preferred presidential candidate would be, **only 29% of all participants chose a Hamas candidate** (Ismail Haniyeh or Yahya al Sinwar). When participants were given a forced-choice option between Barghouti (Fatah), Abbas (Fatah), Haniyeh (Hamas), or declining to vote, **only 23% of all participants chose Haniyeh** (32% when excluding non-voters). Given the choice between Barghouti or Haniyeh, **only 26% of participants chose Haniyeh** (37% of voters).

The most peculiar finding was observed **when participants were asked to choose between Haniyeh and Abbas, with 37% choosing Haniyeh,** 11% choosing Abbas, and half of all participants declining to vote. Among the voters, 77% of the vote went to Haniyeh, and 22% went to Abbas. This reversal of voting trends is unsurprising considering Abbas’ abysmal approval rating as the current president of the State of Palestine.

If parliamentary elections were held today, poll results indicate that **36% would abstain from voting, 30% would vote for Hamas, 14% would vote for Fateh, and 21% would vote other**. Similarly, 35% of respondents living in Gaza would vote for Hamas and 20% would vote for Fateh. In the West Bank, a staggering 45% of respondents said that they would abstain from voting, with 26% voting for Hamas, and only 6% voting for Fateh.

The high percentage of respondents who said they would not participate in elections provides valuable insight into Palestinian attitudes about current and future political circumstances in the Palestinian Territories. It may reflect a general lack of confidence in the political process and/or a perceived lack of viable candidates. While there is wide support for Hamas’ ongoing efforts in the current war,  I am left to wonder how much of that support is given out of necessity. It’s unsurprising given the fact that Hamas are seen as the only protectors of Palestinian people against Israel’s invasion. However, only a third of all Palestinians (more so in Gaza, less so in West Bank) consider Hamas their preferred political party of the future. These result run contrary to public perception. As seen above, most participants consistently chose a non-Hamas option when given other alternatives. **In fact, 62% of respondents stated that they would prefer to have a government that is not controlled by a political party at all.**

Palestinian people, indeed, prefer a representative government that works for them, rather than an authoritarian one.

**METHOD**

**Participants:**

1580 adults from the West Bank (n=830) and the Gaza Strip (n=750) were randomly selected for in-person interviews between March 5-10, 2024.

**Data collection in the Gaza Strip:**

Data was collected from areas with a large population of displaced individuals who were forced by the Israeli army to relocate into those areas. Recruitment locations included shelters, counting areas specified by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, and other sampling areas identified through satellite imaging.

**RESULTS**

**Israel-Hamas War:**

71% view Hamas’ decision to launch the October 7th offensive against Israel as correct

70% of all participants are satisfied with Hamas’ performance in the current war.

64% believe that Hamas will win the current war; 9% believe Israel will win; 18% believe neither Hamas nor Israel will win.

**Humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip:**

44% of Gazans say they only have enough food for a day or two.

77% of Gazans say they have great difficulty accessing food and water when needed; 19% of Gazans say they have an easy access to food and water when needed; 4% they do not have access.

60% of Gazans have a family member who has been killed during the current war; 68% of Gazans say they have a family member who has been injured; 22% of Gazans say none of their family members have been injured nor killed in the current war.

**Fairness of aid distribution to displaced residents currently in shelter:**

70% view aid distribution to be discriminatory; 27% view it as fair.

Most negative attitudes about aid distribution are reported for shelters organized by local Palestinian groups (90% view as discriminatory) and least negative attitudes are reported for shelters organized by the government (56% view as discriminatory).

**Who will rule the Gaza Strip after the war?**

59% believe Hamas will be in control when the war ends; 5% believe Israeli army will be in control.

59% would prefer to see Hamas in control of the Gaza strip after the war (64% West Bank, 52% Gaza).

**State of Palestine - presidential elections:**

When asked who their preferred presidential candidate would be: 40% chose Barghouti (Fatah), 19% chose Haniyeh (Hamas); 10% Yahya al Sinwar (Hamas); 6%  Hussein al-Sheikh (PLO); 25% either chose another candidate or did not chose a candidate.

If a presidential election were to take place between Barghouti (Fatah), Abbas (Fatah), and Haniyeh (Hamas): 48% of all participants would vote for Barghouti; 23% would vote for a Haniyeh; 8% would vote for Abbas; 29% would not participate in the election.

Among the voters only: 56% would vote Barghouti, 32% Haniyeh, 11% Abbas.

When asked to choose between Abbas (Fatah) and Haniyeh (Hamas) only:  37% would vote for Haniyeh, 11% would vote for Abbas, and 52% would not participate in the election or DK/NA.

Among the voters only: 70% Haniyeh; 22% Abbas.

**State of Palestine - parliamentary elections and political party support:**

When asked which party they support, 34% of all participants indicated Hamas; 17% support Fatah; 11% support another party; 37% said none of them or did not know.

If new parliamentary elections were to take place, 30% would vote for Hamas; 14% for Fatah; 6% for a third party; 11% undecided; 36% would not participate in the election.

Among the voters only: 47% support Hamas, 22% support Fatah, 33% other or undecided.

Between the current ruling entities of the Palestinian Territories, 49% said that Hamas is most deserving of representing the Palestinian people; 17% said that Fateh under the leadership of Abbas is most deserving; 29% believe neither are worthy of representation nor leadership.

When asked their preference of authority for the new government, 62% preferred a government that is neither under the control of a political party or president Abbas. 13% preferred a government that is under the control of a political party, 12% under the control of president Abbas.

**Two state solution:**

45% support a two-state solution (62% support in Gaza, 34% support in West Bank)",26/03/24 19:13:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bog8yx/do_palestinians_support_hamas_evidence_from_a/,19,164,1512,Oct 7,top,all

This seems to be a woman of the left wing trying to spin the Oct. 7 attack as a reason for why people shouldn't vote for Bibi. I'm not a Bibi stan but her arguments seem weak, that because Netanyahu let humanitarian aid in, let a few thousand of them work outside of the Strip and not immediately bomb away after a few burning balloons were thrown, he somehow bolstered Hamas? 

And the worst part is how the clickbait headline has probably convinced some people into thinking that Israel created Hamas and gave them weapons to control the ""poor manipulated Palestinians"" (never mind their popular support). 

Now the real responsibility would be his and his government's failure to see the glaring threat of the Strip and not responding quickly enough when it happened. Do you see this as his laziness/incompetency, or was it impossible to predict and impossible to defend the Strip border enough when they also had to focus on protecting the Jews of Judea and Samaria? 

Alternatively, and this is more speculative, did he want them to do a small attack so he would have a good reason to finally purge them and get rid of the threat, thinking it would cement his legacy as a good leader, and due to the sheer unforeseen number of fatalities and destruction they caused, it backfired, leading people to hate him?",30/12/23 13:53:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18ug4eo/how_responsible_do_you_hold_netanyahu_for_the_oct/,20,203,257,Oct 7,top,all
18ac1lt,Cool Palestinian Israeli Podcast,"FYI: I'm a centrist pro Israel American Jew.

I just discovered Unapologetic: The Third Narrative, today.  It's a  new podcast/show between 2 Israeli Arabs, or Palestinian Israelis as they prefer, and it's full of amazingly fresh insights on the conflict.  I just watched 5 hours of it.

I've felt for some time that Israeli Arabs have a key role to play in mediating this conflict.  Israeli Arabs have sided with Israel against Hamas, and I've listened to Mansour Abbas, Captain Ella of the IDF, and Laucy Aharish and been touched by what they had to say.  These 2 podcasters continue in that line, as authentic, young, articulate, well educated, calm, humble observers from the unique vantage point of being both Israeli *and* Palestinian, understanding the trauma of both sides, hating neither, a true ""Third Way"".  Podcast is in English and aimed at a Western audience.

He's Ibrahim Ahmad, 31, a ""48 Arab"", i.e. his family stayed put during 1948 and became Israeli citizens.  He lives in Nazareth, in the north, but has been living and working with Israelis his whole life.  He learned Hebrew young from watching the Israeli kids channel, and he knows a lot about Jewish customs like cleaning for Passover.  He studied in the States for a few years and also in Egypt.  He's secular.

She's Amira Mohammed, 24, raised in California before moving to East Jerusalem / Al Quds as a teenager.  Unlike most Arabs there, she has Israeli citizenship, however, she's had more frequent encounters with checkpoints and Israeli police actions than Ibrahim.  She was a national service volunteer in the Israeli Ministry of Regional Cooperation under minister Issawi Frej, and runs workshops in Israel, Palestine, and Jordan.  She was raised a conservative Muslim but is somewhat more secular now.

Some things they said that I liked or was open to hearing:

* They support a 2SS
* They accept Israel as a Jewish state while advocating for recognition of Palestinian peoplehood.  
* Stop trying to view the conflict as a propaganda scoreboard, e.g., leave aside who was responsible for the al-Ahli hospital strike, bc the bigger picture is people are dying, Palestinians and Israelis.
* Hamas is terrible people and they committed shocking massacres.  But what will replace it after they are gone?  Try to think long term
* Try to be good neighbors initially, rather than good friends 

But really their show can be summed up with this story:

Amira was facilitating a listening session for Israelis and Palestinians and she asked, how did the events of Oct 7 make you feel.  The Israelis spoke about the terrible massacres, their friends on reservist duty, how they were scared for them, and so on.  The Pals did not want to say anything for fear of retaliation.  So Amira had to say it for them: There was not a Palestinian anywhere in the world, who did not feel pride at the photos of the bulldozer breaking through the Gaza fence, bc freedom.  Which got me ANGRY as a Jew and I was about to scream, but I didn't need to, bc Amira also said, but then I saw the horror of the massacres hamas committed, innocent men women children executed raped burned, and my opinion changed.

She's special, that one.  So is Ibrahim.  

Watch their show.

From the first paragraph of the article above in case you can't be bothered reading it:

""Al Arouri was one of the founders of Hamas's military wing and the deputy leader of the group's political bureau. He also headed Hamas's presence in the West Bank""

Sorry, what was that? Headed up Hamas's presence where did you say??????


Ok ok fine, but there's still no proof Hamas gang raped civillians during the attack!!!! 

Weeeeeeell, no. Wrong again:

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/28/world/middleeast/oct-7-attacks-hamas-israel-sexual-violence.html

Or are Sky News and The New York Times all of a sudden untrustworthy sources, Israel shills and or anti Pallestinian? I'm guessing a lot will take this route instead of admitting they were wrong. That they believed the lies or were willfully ignorant because they wanted to believe they'd backed the right team in Hamas! The saddest thing is, I genuinely believe they've know it all along but wanted to be part of the majority crowd as its easier and more popular.

To anyone who has lost friends or family to this propaganda by staying strong and not falling for the lies. Thank you, there is a long way to go but your support is immeasurable. My only advice is that, once  the war is won and the dust literally and metaphorically settles. Don't be too quick to let them grovel their way back into your lives. Make them work for it and prove they've changed.

It's going to be equally tragic as it will be hillarious when everything that has been denied is eventually proven without doubt to be true. They'll never admitted it but the internal shame they face and the inability to look themselves in the mirror having known what they chanted and denied in support of the Hamas animals will be enough for me. They may be able to deny their involvement or claim naivety but internally they'll know and never be able to forget what they said and did. There may be a brave few who'll admit they got caught up in the mob mentality and deeply regret what they did and they'll be forgiven but never EVER forgotten.",02/01/24 21:31:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18x0z0v/there_is_no_hamas_in_the_west_bank/,21,87,357,Oct 7,top,all
194x28h,South Africa case to ICJ,"The topic of South Africa v. Israel case to ICJ is trending in the news and social media. And with that comes a lot of misinformation and generalizations from Palestinian and Israeli side. So I’m curious about the facts and seeking good objective analysis of this topic. I am hoping to learn more about it by posting some open ended questions to get objective debate, analysis and opinions on this topic. Feel free to comment on any of these topics or questions.

South Africa’s role:

Why did the government of South Africa in particular bring this case forward? What are South Africa’s interests in this conflict? Why was not this case brought by Palestine or Iran or Syria or any other Arab country or ally of Palestine?

Genocide case:

Why was this case brought forth in particular while there are many other humanitarian issues and conflicts in the world? Like the attack of Hamas on Oct 7, Sudan refugee crisis, Syrian civil war. Does ICJ not have jurisdiction on these issues? Wouldn’t this open a can of worms where Israel would counter sue for preemptive attacks on civilians or genocidal intent brought forth by Hamas and Hezbollah?

ICJ significance:

What is the significance of the International Court of Justice? What is the impact of its ruling? What kind of punitive action can it rule? Is it just ink on paper or would it rule in pragmatic actions? Or is the intent of such cases to do reputational damage and win the public opinion debate? 

ICJ operation:

It looks like the court leadership is compromised of several judges representing multiple countries. How do the judges work together to come up with a ruling? Do they have to unanimously agree on a ruling or does a majority decide?

Enforcement of ruling:

Who enforces the ruling and would it require a UN members vote? Which members of the UN? How many votes does it require to in force it?",12/01/24 15:00:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/194x28h/south_africa_case_to_icj/,19,167,326,Oct 7,top,all

2:25 PM Oct 18 2023

I was able to visit the huge makeshift morgue where hundreds of bodies of victims of the October 7 attack are piled up. This visit sheds light on the nature of this massacre. How to negotiate with Hamas after that?

The morgue is located on a military base in the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The bodies are kept in dozens of refrigerated containers. Several hundred remains are waiting to be identified.

The Israeli army seeks to give a name to the tortured bodies, but also to document the atrocities committed by the men of Hamas. Because there have been many.

Military bodies are easier to recognize since the army has their DNA. Civilian ones require a lot more work. Most are in very poor condition.

This October night, in the light of powerful halogen lamps, Israel Weiss, 74, welcomes us in uniform with a dull look. The former head of the military rabbinate, returned from retirement, wears a thin white beard, a pair of glasses and a kippah.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8t-5OMWkAE5KwP?format=jpg&name=medium

“I have been in the military for 50 years, I have seen a lot of things, but I have never seen this. We have never seen so many bodies. Every morning I wake up and see new ones and the smell seeps into my heart. The world needs to know what they did.”

According to Israel Weiss, the Hamas attack was not only aimed at killing. The outbreak of violence, the orgy of abuse, the recurrence of horror cannot be a coincidence. In a monotone, exhausted voice, he lists the atrocities recorded.

According to investigations, a large number of victims were burned alive. Old men had their fingers and feet cut off, before being killed, other people were decapitated with an axe.

Many women were found naked, raped before being massacred. A pregnant woman was discovered with her stomach cut open and her fetus torn out; men with internal organs protruding from the stomach.

The charred corpse of a woman appeared normal, except for the thorax. From medical imaging, forensic scientists understood that she was holding her child in her arms when they were burned alive.

According to Israel Weiss, the Hamas killers also burned a group of Thai farm workers tied together to complicate identification. “However, they were not Jews. For what ? They are compared to Daesh. But for me, they remind me of the Nazis.

“They shot in the mouths, in the heads, several times, to destroy the faces. But we will take the time to identify everyone. No mother of a victim will be forgotten.

How can we negotiate the release of almost two hundred hostages with a group responsible for such carnage?

For a week, at the edge of the volcano, Abigaël has been asking herself the question while taking care of the identification of the women and girls and the last rites of purification before returning the body to the families for the funeral.

She must be barely 30 years old, we give her double that. His face is leathery, his voice is a trembling thread.

“Each time, I think I have seen the worst and something even more terrible happens. Children without heads, or drained of their brains, people whose heads have been exploded by several bullets, little girls massacred, still in their pajamas, bodies trapped.

“We are prepared for that. Finally, we thought we were prepared for this. But it's impossible. We have been working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, since the day after the attack. This cruelty is incomprehensible.”

On the base, dozens of staff in white overalls, masks over their noses, wander between several gigantic tents. Wide-eyed guys, lots of religious people, young soldiers, medical students who came to help.

Israel Weiss asks two men equipped with white overalls and construction masks to open two containers where around a hundred victims lie. A terrible smell filled the air.

It's a pestilential, heady smell, a mixture of the scent of rotten meat, spoiled cheese, excrement. In the containers, the bags come in all sizes.

Next door, soldiers regularly vomit. Staff cannot stay on site for long. We need to organize a shift. Dentist, Officer Maayan, takes care of recovering the victims' DNA, fingerprints, checks teeth when they are still present.

She does not hold back her tears as she speaks: “We hear the cries of families, the cries of mothers. We see children in such a state, I can't find the words.

At the exit of the base, we meet Evelyn Chmaya who has been waiting for three days to recover the bodies of her husband and her son, killed by the same bullet while they were embracing in the kibbutz of Re'im.

The day of the attack, the father went to pick up his military son. They died the moment they found each other.
The endless wait put an end to Evelyn's hopes. Too many bodies. Too many hours wasted. She lost her race against time: “I wanted to recover my son's sperm to allow him to give birth despite his death, but it's too late.

Next to her, two welfare workers are returning home. They no longer have a face. They are the ones who welcome the families: “It’s very hard, the army shows the press the ordered part, but an entire side of the base is submerged in corpses. It's endless.

To respond to the unprecedented violence of the October 7 pogrom, Israel chose to respond to violence with violence. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth. A rain of bombs falls on Gaza.

An independent investigation will have to determine who, Israel and Islamic Jihad, is responsible for the bombing of the Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza. Regardless, nearly 3,000 Palestinians have already died from the bombs. (Note from me, of course it was the [Palestinian terrorists](https://news.sky.com/story/gaza-hospital-blast-appears-to-not-have-been-caused-by-israel-says-biden-12986850) as I predicted first in a reddit comment less than an hour after the hospital bombing was first reported)

Mostly civilians, families, hundreds of children.

In the minds of many Israelis met, this famous phrase uttered by Golda Meïr resonates: “We can forgive the Arabs for having killed our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children.

But not all Israelis believe that Gaza must be annihilated to quench this unquenchable thirst for revenge. You may have heard of Noa, kidnapped on a motorbike by two men as she reaches out helplessly to her lover, Avinatan.

We met his father in a modern house in a housing estate in Beer Shiva, in the south of Israel. Yaacov said his prayers while reading the Torah, in front of a television permanently connected to a continuous news channel, without sound.

In the dining room of the house, the neighborhood children set up a small altar in memory of the young girl. “Noa, we’re waiting for you, stay strong.
Yaacov has no news of his daughter or the ongoing negotiations to save her. And he doesn't think that bombing Gaza will make him feel Noa: “What's the point of killing each other? Revenge achieves nothing.

“You have to think with your heart, not with your logic. I think a negotiation is good for both sides. Trade, not arms, as Shimon Perez said”

“There are dead people in Gaza, people crying too. How is this useful? The best thing is to sit down and talk. This is what we did with Egypt and Jordan. With the Palestinians, we are like brothers. We practically have the same blood.

Yaacob begs the kidnappers to let his daughter, “the most precious thing in my eyes,” live. “Let us exchange our prisoners, make peace; I know there are sensitive people in Gaza with real hearts. I don't see them as savages.

Yaacov holds back his tears. He tells of Noa, her energy, her travels, hesitating between the present and the past, recalling that she is his only daughter, “my continuity, the source of my strength. His wife, Noa's mother, is sick, she has cancer. The situation made his case worse.

“Since Noa was born, there has been a light in the house. And look around you, there's nothing there now. I can’t eat anymore, I can’t sleep, I can’t do anything anymore.”

On October 12, Noa celebrated her 26th birthday in captivity. Yaacov organized a party at his home with around thirty relatives: “We sang “Happy Birthday” while crying.”

17h6xsq,Genocide: a possible shift in narratives,"One of the main rallying calls of the pro-Palestinian side at the moment, is the accusation that Israeli attacks constitute a ""genocide"". That, of course, is not a new accusation, or one that's really tied to the current airstrikes. Not only was this accusation trotted out with every Israeli engagement in Gaza, it was part of the original statement by the infamous Durban Conference's NGO forum, made all the way back in 2001 (just a few days before 9/11), that described Israel as a ""racist, apartheid state"" that was guilty of ""racist crimes including war crimes, acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing"".

So far, the Israeli establishment largely ignored that accusation, while the pro-Israelis online dismissed it, by pointing out the numbers of dead simply don't add up to a ""genocide"" of any sort. That indeed, even after many decades of ""slow genocide"", the Palestinian population only increased, at one of the fastest rates in the world. That it's not a ""slow"" genocide, but more of a ""reverse"" one.

However, there's a new development, that was missed by many: the atrocities of October 7th lead [a group of 100 experts](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-actions-are-war-crimes-could-constitute-genocide-international-law-experts/) in international law to declare Hamas has ""most probably"" committed the ""crime of genocide, proscribed by the Genocide Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court"". That there *was* a genocide committed between Israel and Palestine, but Jews were the victims of it.

As far as I understand it, the argument is that ""genocide"", based on international law, consists of two necessary parts:

1. Crimes against humanity: the systematic, intentional targeting of civilians for murder, rape, and other atrocities. That part isn't really in debate, except among conspiratorial-minded pro-Palestinian True Believers.
2. Genocidal intent: this one is harder to prove. It relies on statements of Hamas members, Hamas propaganda messaging, as well as official documents like the original 1988 Hamas Charter, that quotes a Hadith about the genocide of all Jews at the end of the days. The same quote was used, notably, by the early Palestinian leader Hajj Amin al-Husseini in his pro-Holocaust propaganda booklet he wrote for Bosnian SS troops.

The part that *doesn't* exist in this definition, is that the population numbers are actually significantly reduced. In that sense, they argue, it's less like the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide or Rwandan genocide, and more similar to the genocide of Yazidis by ISIS in 2019 (\~2,000-5,000 dead), the Srebrenica genocide in 1995 (\~8,000 deaths).

Personally, I feel that ""genocide"" should be reserved for actual cases where a population is significantly reduced. While the kinds of atrocities that happened to Yazidis under ISIS, and Israelis under Hamas are blood-curdling, I feel they should belong to a category of its own - perhaps ""[genocidal massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocidal_massacre)"", or something that doesn't focus on the genocidal aspect of it, or even the mass killing aspect, but the sheer inhumanity of the perpetrators, and the dehumanization of their victims. However, I can't really argue that the vague definition used in international law fits. And that this argument, if deployed, could change the narrative significantly.

# What it means for the Palestinians

It's notable that despite their insistence on the ""genocide"" accusations, the pro-Palestinians don't usually make the argument I just did. While a group of pro-Palestinian academics released a statement that [mirrors the Israeli one](https://twailr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gaza-public-statement-and-signatories.pdf), it didn't get anywhere near as much traction as their usual arguments. Ultimately, the main Palestinian argument of ""genocide"" *is* relying on the numbers. Even though their numbers clearly aren't enough to compare to the actual genocides, and the fact the pro-Israelis keep poking at that very fact.

The reason is simple: the legal definition relies on intent. Both the intentional murder of civilians to begin with, and the intent to do so in order to reduce the numbers of the population. Pro-Palestinians have been conditioned to simply assume the most evil intent by Israelis, automatically and without any further thought than ""Israelis are the devil incarnate"". That's the thing that made them completely convinced of the reality of this genocide, and being appalled that nobody but their diehard supporters take it seriously. But on the other side, it made them far less equipped to actually *prove* that intent.

It's true that the past few weeks provided them with a lot of bad quotes from Israeli officials and journalists about ""flattening Gaza"", and ""turning Gaza into Dresden"". But that's pretty common among any countries that suffered such blows - few argue the US committed multiple genocides since 9/11, despite equally horrible rhetoric. And of course, Hamas, Iran and all of Israel's enemies, have been saying worse things for literally their entire existence. And without the mitigating circumstances of being just a few weeks from a historic atrocity against their people. And there's nothing as brazen as putting a dream of genocide in Hamas' charter, on the Israeli side.

But more importantly, they didn't even prove the first part: that Israel's target is to murder Palestinian civilians. It's not impossible to argue that even though a siege or large-scale bombings aren't criminal generally speaking, their specific use provide evidence of targeting civilians. For example, the first week, when Israel refused to let in Egyptian humanitarian aid. But it's several orders of magnitude harder than for the blatant atrocities committed by Hamas death squads.

However, that doesn't mean this is a complete loss for them. While it's hard to prove the Israeli bombings and incursions into Gaza are genocide, it's far easier to apply it to other cases, most notably the Nakba in 1948. They might also trot out the UNGA / Seán MacBride call that Sabra and Shatila was a genocide - and try to downplay the fact Israelis weren't actually the ones who committed it. Even if the Israelis could argue that this was a genocide, the Palestinians could argue it was a ""counter-genocide"", after a genocide, or multiple genocides against their own people.

# What it means for Israelis

I don't really see Israelis and pro-Israelis leaning into the ""genocide"" argument at the moment. So far, the old, pre-October 7th narrative seems to be alive and well. Palestinians cry about the attacks on them being genocide, because so many died. Israelis pointing out that actually, not enough died for it to be considered a genocide. And I feel there's a good motive for both to maintain that argument. Israelis know the Palestinian argument isn't taken seriously by the international community, and they aren't particularily thrilled to recall the atrocities of 1948 or the less-known massacres since.

But there's one key point that might force that narrative on them. Even as we speak, the national forensic institute and the Israeli police are building what will be the largest criminal investigation in Israeli history. It's very possible that in order for Israelis to feel they've won this conflict, they'll need to capture a Hamas leader, and put him on an Eichmann-like trial. It's more than likely there would be a tribunal for all the of living participants of the massacre, akin to the one in Yugoslavia, Tokyo or Nuremberg. The Israeli public would probably not accept garden variety indictments for murder and terrorism. This event is already shaping out to be a unique horror in Jewish history, and Jews refer to it with direct references to the Holocaust (""the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust"").  If those trials happen, an accusation of Crime Against Humanity is more or less certain. Genocide, somewhat likely.

# What it means for the human rights NGOs

Another part of this, are the human rights NGOs, that since the 2000's have been actively recruiting pro-Palestinian activists, self described ""soldiers for Palestine"" and BDSers, to cover the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A trend that culminated with them suddenly realizing, at the same time, that Israel was actually guilty of Apartheid for 50-75 years, and they just kinda forgot to notice.

Those NGOs have been reacting to this conflict in the way you'd expect them. A limp-wristed, often explicitly both-sidey condemnation of the Hamas atrocities. Followed by a massive campaign that paints Israel as the exclusive criminal, and its fight against Hamas as a wholly illegal massacre. I feel it's more than likely than their next ""explosive report"", or more accurately, next concession to Palestinian nationalist propaganda, is one that directly accuses Israel of genocide. Something that they've been somewhat reluctant to do so far.

The argument Hamas committed a genocide presents them with a bit of a conundrum. Their Apartheid case is very formalistic, far closer to the one I've mentioned, than the colloquial Palestinian ""lots of civilians die = genocide"". And on that level, the case for Hamas committing genocide is much stronger than the case for Israel committing genocide. While there's one obvious solution, a [Rwandan ""double genocide""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_genocide_theory_(Rwanda)), it doesn't quite serve the Palestinian narrative - which, I remind you, is the main goal here. Same goes for accusing both sides of mere ""atrocities"" and implicitly admitting the Palestinian accusations of genocide are, and were always nonsense. The Apartheid reports were such a powerful indictment, in part because they barely mentioned Palestinian terrorism, beyond dismissing it as an excuse. That would be far harder here.

A separate, but related issue that I see here, is the increased polarization on that case. So far, and unlike previous events, the Israelis have a very compelling human rights case. People on the ""respectable pro-Palestinian"" side are learning it's not as easy to push their viewpoints, and not get any lashback. BBC and the NYT are publishing apologies, for merely doing the same thing they've been doing for over a decade, and treating Hama claims as gospel. Big universities are finding themselves in awkward situations, where their pro-Palestinian students university-sanctioned behavior leads to credible allegations for racism against Jewish students, and upsets donors. Pro-Palestinian individuals and organizations suddenly find themselves pushed to the fringes. If the likes of HRW and Amnesty aren't careful, they might find themselves completely pushed out of the mainstream.

# The horrible wildcard

Finally, I'd note that this post is written before the ground assault has actually began. The reality is, we have no idea what war crimes Israelis might commit once they get into the most intense, bloody urban combat in recent history. I don't expect a full repeat of the Hamas atrocities, if only because they were seemed to be meticulously planned from above, and Israel has nothing to gain from something like that. But individual atrocities from Israeli soldiers, as well as a leadership that isn't keen on punishing it, are absolutely possible. If the dust settles, and we see even 10% of the Oct. 7 atrocities committed by Israeli soldiers, even a single Palestinian family that was tortured, raped, dismembered, tied and burned alive, that would obviously change the picture. But since it's completely theoretical at this point, I can't say anything about it, except that I deeply hope it doesn't happen.",26/10/23 21:17:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17h6xsq/genocide_a_possible_shift_in_narratives/,18,23,1823,Oct 7,top,all

1amedtz,100 days of the ground war - Part 3 of my blogpost.,"I am from India and an independent blogger on Geopolitics, (Indian) national security and business.   
I have blogged on the war, without taking sides, focusing only on the military aspects of the conflict.   
I post data based, original analysis, because I was unable to find any and I believe this will be useful to the forum. This is a free blog and I do not solicit advertising, hence I do not think I am violating forum rules by linking the blog post. This is part 3 of my series on Gaza:

[https://rpdeans.blogspot.com/2024/02/gaza-war-part-3-100-days-of-ground-war.html](https://rpdeans.blogspot.com/2024/02/gaza-war-part-3-100-days-of-ground-war.html)

I conclude that after taking relatively high casualties till Dec - and causing high civilian casualties, the IDF has improved the quality of its operations, as seen from its sharply reduced casualties and civilian deaths in Jan (per day) being a fifth of the Oct-Nov levels, while destroying a significant part of Hamas. This has led to the IDF being able to withdraw forces and strengthen their presence on the Lebanon border against Hezbollah. The first 2 parts of the blog post, provide more detail of the IDFs order of battle and casualties. 

 While Hezbollah has been under increasing pressure to act, due to a possible collapse of Hamas and Israel's attacks on their leadership, their attacks have so far been ineffective.   
For the US, 2 others factors that will decide if this conflict is a strategic setback, or will strengthen its presence in the region, is the Houthis ability to disrupt shipping in the Red sea and the US ability to maintain its bases in Syria and Iraq. If they do both, it will diminish Iran's ability to project power through its proxies. A significant variable is weather Israel, if they feel Hamas has bene neutralized and after replenishing its munitions and resting some of its units, will go after Hezbollah. 

I welcome comments on my blog. In the course of my career I have worked in Iran and done business with Israel and the Arab world (at the same time) and learnt that this conflict is more nuanced than \`one side good the other evil'. India has friendly relations with both Israel and the Palestinian authority (while condemning Oct 7 as a terrorist act). Both India and Israel have been victims of Islamist terror for decades and have often been the only 2 islands of democracy in a sea of hostile dictatorships.

19d4rr0,To counter the Hamas narrative: Which proof do we have of Hamas soldiers executing civilians?,"Hi,

kind of in response to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/19czixd/the_107_denialism_and_historical_revisionism_has/) about Oct 7 denialism, I was wondering what kind of solid proof we have for the bigger atrocities that were committed. It would help to shut up all those that believe the Hamas narrative. It's clear that lot's of people died (with lot's of pictures like those on the *saturday-october-seven* website), but not very clear who killed them and why.

Are there any such websites, with video investigations?

Hamas blamed some other groups, civilians and even Israel. We know there was friendly fire. And, given all the lies during war it's of course a good idea to second-guess stories that Israel puts out. Nevertheless, for sure some Hamas-fighters killed innocent people during the attack that didn't pose any risks to them. And some articles say they went door to door to execute people.

So as we know Hamas filmed and even live-streamed the event. Lot's of locals must have taken and shared videos too.

* So, are there any videos of Hamas lining up/executing people that didn't have guns?
* Videos of the music festival, where they hunt down and shoot dozens of people?
* Are there any such mass-killings that have multiple witnesses, or 3rd party video evidence?
* Is there a video investigation of videos individual women/elderly being killed that were clearly just civilians without weapons?

Especially at the Re'im music festival massacre, where 360+ civilians have died, probably has such content.

18is4z3,Is the anti-Israeli group the loud majority or the loud minority? When will this story end?,"If you look at news, you see tons and tons and tons of anti-Israeli around the west, and what must be a coincidence and totally not at all related, anti-semetic protests. If you look at tiktok and college campuses, you think Israel and jews are enemy #1. The vitriol against israel is unseen of in our time (as people ignore hamas starting a war, promising it will repeat oct 7 until all of israel is destroyed, and and ensuring gazan people were uninformed and used as shields and solely blame israel for deaths as if there was now a way to hurt Hamas without civilian damage). However, the slight bit from elections, both in Netherlands and Argentina, have suggested the opposite. Pro-israel parties are doing better and their is new anti-immigrant support (which we shouldn't judge all immigrants but anti semitic protestors). And long term, what is the ramification. Is this going to be a pro-Israel or anti-israel shift in the west (and the world)? People will say BLM was amazingly popular, but the trump biden election, with trump as a very unpopular candidate, was extremely close (and that was after RBG passing, covid etc).

Also, when will this story end and a new one start. And by that, I do not mean israel vs palestine. The issue will take years. But when is it not going to be extreme anti semitic anti israeli protests and the media is centered on israel vs palestine. In the last years and before Oct 7, we had many headlines: Hong Kong, derick chaves/BLM, metoo, iran, ukraine, myanmar, afganistan, china rohinga, syria, israeli protest against netanyahu. I am curious that once hamas is defeated, is that enough for a new news cycle to occur. My suspicion is that is trump is the nominee for GOP, everything is dropped an America goes into a ""trump referendum"" where he becomes the sole talking point (I personally wouldnt vote for trump as of now. I am only saying this is the most likely the quickest way i think the newsline wouldnt stay on israel). If trump is not the nominee, then israel will be a focus. But can another international event become the story, or is israel vs palestine here to stick. Even BLM and MeToo rose and fell. And while all these stories still exist, none have the mass support they had or the mass headlines. BLM sacked parts of cities and it felt like that story would stay, but even that died down as trump referendum essentially became the only talking point.

1b85cns,How accurate is this perspective from a news article?,"I’ve engaged in some very interesting conversations in this sub and came across an article online from a source that I’m unfamiliar with. The perspective from the Israeli side on this article was the most compelling that I’ve read so far and wanted to check and see how accurate it is. I appreciate your feedback.


“Israeli television news reports almost nothing of what is happening to civilians in Gaza; the only images they show are of ruined houses, earth churned up by armored personnel carriers and flattened landscapes. The images of overflowing emergency rooms with wounded children lying on the floor, of rescuers pulling people out of crushed buildings, of mass graves and the tent camp at Rafah, are entirely absent. This selective reporting is not new — I described the same phenomenon in a 2009 piece for the Columbia Journalism Review about the Israeli media’s coverage of Operation Cast Lead.
As I wrote then, and this remains true today, Israelis have always felt that they face constant existential threats from their neighbors and that a powerful military response is the only possible deterrent. They are still utterly traumatized by the attacks Hamas carried out on Oct. 7; it’s fair to say that, more than four months later, they are still living the events of that terrible day, which many — perhaps most — see as proof that peace with the Palestinians is impossible. In this atmosphere, there is no appetite for self-criticism or compassion for the other side, so television news is patriotic about the war, highlighting soldiers’ bravery and showing only scenes devoid of humans in Gaza; the destroyed buildings are described as Hamas hideouts or places where soldiers discovered weapons caches. This coverage reinforces the widespread conviction that “their” soldiers don’t deliberately harm civilians, that people die because Hamas uses them as human shields, and that the international media is axiomatically anti-Israel.
Most Israelis speak English well enough to follow the news about Gaza in the international media, but for the most part they choose to let their own media act as gatekeepers. In this role, a television news presenter will summarize an article or television report critical of Israel that was published in an international media outlet and hold it up as evidence that the world doesn’t care about Israel’s trauma, or doesn’t understand its need to reestablish security after the Hamas incursion of Oct. 7. Scrolling through Israeli social media makes clear that the vast majority of Israelis are either unaware of what Palestinians are enduring in Gaza, or simply do not believe the reports in the international media.”

19b0dgq,Is Bibi trying to save the hostages?,"As far as I can tell, Yoav Gallant and Bibi are trying to pretend they live in a universe where they didn’t tremendously fail on Oct 7. They believe if they push onward with the war, they can keep their jobs or at least go out with their political reputations salvaged, and perhaps make a second hurrah down the road. If a rational actor were running the show, he would keep all the secured territory in north Gaza permanently, along with a few miles of border buffer stretching all the way down to Egypt, and then throw over a deal that ends the conflict with Hamas keeping control over some southern territory. That’s a sufficient buffer to prevent something like October 7 from ever happening again. 

What people need to come to terms with is that Oct 7 reflects a tremendously bad security architecture that rested, not on an assessment of Hamas maximum capabilities, but on an assessment of their intentions and rationality. The IDF was treating Gaza like a zoo, instead of a hostile adversary. Nobody ever thought they would  attempt a mass invasion, so nobody prepared for one. Cutting Hamas controlled Gaza in half reduces their surface area, deprives them of a tremendous amount of their capability and tunnel network, and allows for two layers of militarization around Hamas. If they ever “break out” they will be in IDF controlled Gaza, and the only hostages available will be Palestinian. 

Yahya Sinwar’s death and the destruction of every single tunnel in Gaza would certainly feel good, but is not a prerequisite to render Hamas incapable of ever launching an Oct 7th like attack again. The means to prevent future attacks have already been secured. Anything further is purchasing positive feelings at the expense of Israel’s greater strategic needs. Get the hostages home. Let humanitarian aid in. Work on a political solution wrt the Palestinians. Fix the flawed security architecture. Don’t keep stepping in PR shit, complicating Israel’s diplomatic future with the Arab world and Europe, imperiling US support, and risking the hostages lives…just so that Bibi and Yoav can gamble on a reputational comeback.

Bibi and Yoav need to bite the bullet, accept the loss, and pass on the reigns to someone who has no political baggage, and can assess the situation from the best interests of Israel, and protect Israeli lives.",20/01/24 01:55:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/19b0dgq/is_bibi_trying_to_save_the_hostages/,13,50,393,Oct 7,top,all
18f5x0t,Israeli tanks reach centre of Khan Younis in new storm of southern Gaza,"[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/palestinians-report-israeli-battles-khan-younis-after-us-blocks-gaza-ceasefire-2023-12-10/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/palestinians-report-israeli-battles-khan-younis-after-us-blocks-gaza-ceasefire-2023-12-10/)

Israeli tanks battled their way to the centre of Khan Younis on Sunday in a major new push into the heart of the main city in the southern Gaza Strip which is sheltering hundreds of thousands of civilians who fled other parts of the enclave.  
  
Residents said tanks had reached the main north-south road through the middle of Khan Younis after intense combat through the night that had slowed the Israeli advance from the east. Warplanes were pounding the area west of the assault.  
  
The air rumbled with the constant thud of explosions and thick columns of white smoke rose over the city. As morning broke near a city-centre police station, the constant rattle of machinegun fire could be heard. Streets there were deserted apart from an old woman and a girl riding on a donkey cart.  
  
""It was one of the most dreadful nights, the resistance was very strong, we could hear gunshots and explosions that didn't stop for hours,"" a father of four displaced from Gaza City and sheltering in Khan Younis told Reuters. He declined to be identified for fear of reprisals.  
  
""In Khan Younis tanks reached Jamal Abdel-Nasser Street, which is at the centre of the city. Snipers took positions on buildings in the area,"" he said.  
  
At the opposite end of the Gaza Strip, in northern areas where Israel had previously said its forces had largely completed their tasks, residents also described some of the most intense fighting of the war so far.  
  
Israeli troops were pushing into militant strongholds and meeting fierce resistance in Jabaliya and the Shejjaiya district of Gaza City, areas that are still inhabited despite orders weeks ago to clear out of the entire north.  
  
""I daresay it is the strongest battle we have heard in weeks,"" said Nasser, 59, a father of seven sheltering in Jabaliya after his house was destroyed in Beit Lahiya, another northern area. Explosions could be heard as he spoke. ""We are not going to leave Jabaliya regardless of everything. We shall die here as martyrs or they will leave us alone.""  
  
Israel vowed to annihilate Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, after militants burst across the fence on Oct. 7 and went on a rampage through Israeli towns, gunning down families in their homes, killing 1,200 people and seizing 240 hostages.  
  
Since then, Gaza's health authorities say at least 17,700 people have been confirmed killed in Israeli strikes, with thousands more missing and presumed dead under rubble. The toll no longer includes figures from northern parts of the enclave, beyond the reach of ambulances and where hospitals have ceased functioning.  
  
WHO'S ALIVE?  
After weeks of fighting concentrated in the north, Israel launched its ground offensive in the south this week with a storm of Khan Younis. With combat now under way along nearly the entire length of the Gaza Strip, international aid organisations say the enclave's 2.3 million people have been left with nowhere to hide.

At the site of one Khan Younis home that had been destroyed by bombing overnight, relatives of the dead were combing the rubble in a daze. They dragged the body of a middle-aged man in a yellow T-shirt from under the masonry.  
  
""We prayed the nighttime prayer and went to sleep, then woke up to find the house on top of us. 'Who's alive?!'"" said Ahmed Abdel Wahab.  
  
""Three floors above collapsed down and the people are under it,"" he said. ""My mother and father, my sister and brother, all of my cousins.""  
  
The main hospital in Khan Younis, Nasser hospital, has been overrun with dead and wounded. On Sunday there was no floor space left in the emergency department as people carried in more wounded wrapped in blankets and carpets. Mohamed Abu Shihab wailed and swore revenge for a son he said had been killed by an Israeli sniper.  
  
The Israeli military said it bombed underground tunnel shafts in Khan Younis and attacked a squad of Palestinian gunmen preparing an ambush, but said nothing about any tank advance.  
  
The vast majority of Gaza's residents have now been forced from their homes, many fleeing several times with only the belongings they can carry. Israel says it is doing what it can to protect civilians, but even its closest ally the United States says it has fallen short of those promises.  
  
An Israeli siege has cut off supplies, with the United Nations warning of mass hunger and disease.  
  
At an international conference in Doha, capital of Qatar which acted as the main mediator for a week-long truce that saw more than 100 hostages freed, Arab foreign ministers criticised the United States for vetoing a U.N. Security Council resolution on Friday that demanded a humanitarian ceasefire.  
  
Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said the war risked radicalising a generation across the Middle East. Jordan's foreign minister said the Israeli campaign aimed to drive Palestinians from Gaza and met the legal definition of genocide, accusations Israel called outrageous.  
  
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he would ""not give up"" appealing for a ceasefire.  
  
""I urged the Security Council to press to avert a humanitarian catastrophe and I reiterated my appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire to be declared,"" Guterres said. ""Regrettably, the Security Council failed to do it, but that does not make it less necessary.""  
  
Israel has spurned demands it halt the fighting. Briefing his cabinet on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had told the leaders of France, Germany and other countries: ""You cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas, and on other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas.""",10/12/23 15:25:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18f5x0t/israeli_tanks_reach_centre_of_khan_younis_in_new/,13,17,943,Oct 7,top,all
17pmmx2,Ceasefire,"Why ceasefire is beyond stupid idea?

1)  When did Palestine stopped sending rockets to Israel? Did Palestine ceasefire even before and after Oct 7? They did NOT. Palestine keeps sending rockets to Israel every single day fro MANY YEARS. Despite that, Israel did NOT declare war to Palestines because it was all most blocked by Iron Dome. Though its common sense that was already more than enough to declare a war. Yet, Israel did NOT.

Israel only declared a war after Oct 7 Palestine committed genocidal terrorism massacre to unarmed civillians village and party that ALL living and non-lving things was all killed and destroyed.

2) If there will be a ceasefire, just like before Palestine will continue to launch THOUSANDS of rockets to Israel. Don't underestimate Palestine homemade rockets, why? Its designed for TERRORISM. Palestine rockets is no different from IED which are all illegal in international law. Palestine rockets are filled of shrapnels like IED. Will Israel will just keep blocking those rockets again and again for many years every single day?

3) ceasefire to those who committed genocidal terrorism is like telling you stop can filing a criminal case to those who massacre your entire family and burned your house, and just let them FREE LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. Or letting thousands of ISIS terrorist free.

4) who is in the right mind who wanted to live in the house where your neighbors are those who committed genocidal terrorism that even babies was not spared? Ceasefire is like letting them be YOUR entire family their NEXT VICTIM. Remember that they massacred the villages  they are VERY HAPPY. They will continue to REPEAT it, its make them happy and they even praise their allah for that.

5) lastly, the terrorist will able to escape and will be VERY HAPPY like a clown laughing for fooling you. Why let them escape when theyre are already in your radar?

1buciia,Casualties of war,"Edit> TLDR: If you continue to the end you will understand that the statements are ridiculous, whatever side you support instead of justifying blindly scrutinise them the same way you scrutinise the other side. Two sides of the same coin.

Some holier than thou nonsense

“It’s expected to see collateral damage in war”, 

“oh it was an accident those aid workers died”, 

“those civilians death are acceptable as long as Hamas fighters are dead, its war”

“They shouldn’t have voted for Hamas”


Let me for a second try to justify the same way some pro Israeli apologists justify IDF actions

What Hamas did in oct 7 is not a terrorist act it was an act of freedom fighters trying to fight for their country

Israel revised death toll is 1200; 315 of which are military personnel, 870  civilians 29 of which are children and 15 security forces personnel an acceptable ratio given that Hamas stated they are fighting the IDF

It’s pretty difficult for Hamas to identify who is civilians from military personnel because it mandatory for all Israelis to serve in the military, making them justifiable targets. It’s unfortunate kids died but that’s the reality of war.

Honestly it’s their fault cuz they voted for bibi and his government actions in oppressing the palis justifies Hamas right for self defence.

And what even can tell us that the figures given by the Israeli government is true and those rapes actually occurred, they have a track record of lying, I bet all the out of the 1200 death only 200 are civilians.

Some pro Israeli trying to claim the higher moral ground while lumping pro Hamas and pro Palestinians claiming they are war loving, lesser intellectuals while they act the same way they accuse them of.

I can appreciate that both sides have their grievances but to be totally blind, to justify a crime and deny wrong doing, when you accuse  the other side of ignoring visual evidence of their sides crime while in the same time denying the existence of yours is just rich.

Many in this conflict on both sides are two sides of the same coin.

1adgljb,Who we talk about when we talk about Hamas,"Can someone help me get a more detailed understanding of who Israel is fighting/targeting?

The current war is often referred to (in English at least) as the Israel-Hamas War, with that exact term returning around 165,000,000 Google search results. When Netanyahu announced that Israel was at war, [he described it as a war against Hamas.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyXBgQ1jy4Q) We see examples of Israel's basic and primary war goal being described as [destroying Hamas](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/what-is-the-group-hamas-a-simple-guide-tothe-palestinian-group). Hamas is a Palestinian Sunni Islamist political and military organization governing the Gaza Strip, founded in 1987 by Ahmed Yassin. Israel's goal would then seem to be reducing Hamas's numbers to a point that they are no longer able to function as an organization, and destroying enough military infrastructure that Hamas could not pose any further risk.

Of course it has also been suggested that Israel's real goal is to create conditions of such misery in the civilian population that they turn on Hamas.

And here's where I start having questions.

Presumably Israel's primary Hamas targets are [al-Qassam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades) members, right? But they also have to kill or otherwise incapacitate (imprison or expel) a large number of civilian members in order to destroy Hamas. If the civilian wings of Hamas remain intact/functional, they'll be able to rebuild their military wing eventually. Israel has claimed that it has killed 2 civilians for every militant, and some reports have gone out with estimates of 9000 militants killed. But when Israel says ""militant"" do they mean ""Hamas member"" where a civilian member of Hamas could be a legitimate target in their view and therefore a ""militant""? Or do they literally mean militant? Quite a few of the journalists killed by Israel were part of/affiliated with [Hamas or another militant organization](https://cpj.org/2024/01/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/). Do they count as militants or civilians? And roughly how many Hamas militants and civilians are we talking about when we say ""destroy Hamas""?

And that leads me to another whole thing. The BBC has reported that [there is evidence of five other militant groups taking part in the Oct. 7 massacres](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67480680) alongside Hamas militants, including the [Al-Quds Brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Brigades), [Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ali_Mustafa_Brigades), and [Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Martyrs%27_Brigades). After the IDF launched its invasion of Gaza, the forces seem to have engaged with al Qassam militants primarily, but also [with militants from other groups](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-30-2023). It's possible that the clashes with other militants are incidental and not part of the IDF's primary mission, which is to destroy Hamas and only Hamas. But it's also possible that ""Hamas"" is actually shorthand for a larger number of groups. I can certainly see why Israel would target Hamas and other groups. There's basic retaliation for Oct. 7, and probably also an understanding that there will be a power vacuum if Israel can destroy Hamas. It's not like Israel will be super secure if Islamic Jihad takes over. Does anyone know if there's information about whether Israel is trying to destroy Hamas and only Hamas, or trying to destroy other militant groups as well?

Because this brings us back to the first set of questions. As far as I can tell some militant groups are only militant groups (e.g. Al Aqsa) while others have civilian wings (e.g. Al-Quds as part of [Islamic Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad), [which also operates mosques and schools](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4241588,00.html)) or are also political parties (e.g. Abu Ali Mustafa as part of the [PFLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine)) that presumably have civilian members in addition to militants. If the Israel is targeting other militant groups for destruction, are they also interested in killing/incapacitating members of those groups who aren't part of the militant wings?

I'm trying to get a better understanding of what specific victory conditions Israel is pursuing. I'm sure Israel has things like kill lists of high-impact targets, and estimates of casualty numbers that would represent enough to be satisfied that Hamas (and possibly other organizations) have been destroyed. I don't expect that much if any of that will be public, but there could be hints, analysis based on targets already hit etc. that would give us some idea. I just haven't been able to find much that helps me get a more concrete understanding of the answer to ""how will Israel be able to tell when they've completed their mission?"" In other words, how will Israel know it's reached the day before ""[the day after](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4391112-dangerous-ideas-about-the-day-after-in-gaza/)""?",28/01/24 23:33:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1adgljb/who_we_talk_about_when_we_talk_about_hamas/,11,31,714,Oct 7,top,all
18igvdn,Why do people side with terrorists?,"People on this subreddit and other communities feel frustrated about the massive support beams for Palestine but on the other hand, only Jewish people have demonstrated to demand the release of hostages. For the people in question, Those so called pro Palestine people completely ignore what happened in oct. 7 and now they feel vulnerable and unprotected and the reason people are showing hostility towards Israel couldn’t be simpler: antisemitism. Especially that this attack comes after decades of rocket firing and suicide bombing etc. So by calling out Israel you’re either a terrorist or an antisemite and in both cases your ultimate goal is to destroy the Jews. 

Did you guys try to see the Israeli soldiers from the other lens? I understand that wars are tragic and often times soldiers abolish their rules of engagement with full impunity, I’ve been a soldier in the anti-terrorism corps myself and I’ve seen worse. But the extreme level of hate and blood-thirst the Israeli soldiers are showing is unbelievable; Executions at point blank, blowing up houses, hospitals, schools and mosques for fun, stripping off and blindfolding Palestinians(who were later released), bulldozing and vandalizing homes and properties, blowing up a house as a gift for a 2-year old kid and singing in a mosque. For some, the Israeli army is what stands against the demise of Jewish people, but for real have you tried to look at it from another lens? How does that defend Israel and keep the Jewish people safe? I’ve seen some terrorist shit (beheading, mass shooting, enslaving women) but I’ve never seen more horrific behavior than the Israeli army’s. Hamas are literally amateurs compared to the Israeli army. Israeli soldiers are terrorists too?

17cmwv6,"As an American Jew, I am pissed we are spending billions to clean up the mess of Al-Aqsa Mosque.","I have been studying this conflict like a Talmudic scholar, and clearly the ghastly Oct 7 massacre was planned for a long time. I have become very sympathetic to the Israeli position because of the unjust blaming of the IDF for the hospital strike and intractable problem that many Palestinians and their Arab supporters want a full reversal of the Nakba rather than a feasible political solution.

Except for one thing: The US should not send a dime until the rights of Al-Aqsa Mosque are secured.

The Israeli settlers who took it upon themselves to break decades of custom over the Al-Aqsa mosque must be condemned. I am hopping mad the United States is ensnared in a religious war and the world is twisted in knots so a handful of zealots can sacrifice *a goddamned goat.*

Apparently, Israel's supporters have gotten quite comfortable framing the Al-Aqsa conflict as a religious freedom issue. Unilaterally breaking decades of tradition that secured the peace so a religious sect can [do things Islam holds sacrilegious](https://www.countere.com/home/a-red-heifer-is-the-secret-to-understanding-the-israel-hamas-war) is arrogant beyond belief, and the entitlement that the United States will ride in to the rescue as they stick a finger in the eye of the Muslim world has me furious.

No one gets to 'fix' the past to be the version you like best. This is exactly what the Jihadists feel they are doing. You don't get to wave around secular values like religious freedom while trampling decades-old customs that secured the peace.

The future of Israel is either a multi-generational project of building trust until future generations are wise enough to co-exist in peace, or you can let the fanatics do as they please while you live in a fortress, until enough Arabs are pissed off that some madman detonates a nuke in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. Which happens to be exactly what evangelicals in the US pray for.

Israelis who break the peace in Al-Aqsa know exactly what they are doing. They betray Jewish people the world over by inviting a forever-war, and they abuse Israel's ally in the US as rivals fire missiles at our ships.

I'll see if I can explain it. Follow the links if you want more info.

**October 7th**

\---

Until and including October 6th, Israeli and [US intelligence](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/u-s-all-but-stopped-spying-on-hamas-in-years-after-9-11-ebe8d61d) were all but certain that Hamas had been deterred and did not want a confrontation. To be fair, the US relied on Israeli intelligence in part for that.

What Hamas did on October 7th will be studied by military analysts for many decades, in the same manner as Sharon's Battle of Abu-Ageila. Hamas launched a [Total War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war), using a [Combined Arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_arms) strategy. South Korea is already [simulation-exercising](https://time.com/6329092/north-south-korea-us-hamas-military-exercise/) an attack based on Hamas, emanating from North Korea.

In essence, we have here a terrorist army executing a manouver that Ukraine hasn't perfected after 9yrs of American and NATO investment in their capabilities.

Think about what this means and could possibly mean: Hamas successfully executed a military manouver many established armed forces can't pull off. Imagine if they export their knowledge to other terrorist groups.

\---

**October 8th**

\---

Hamas is not a disciplined army. They're an army of terrorists high on Koranic mythology and religious-nationalist superiority. As such, while they have proven capable of co-ordinating military manouvers, they lack the self-awareness and tactical capability to understand that what you do matters as much as how you do it.

What Hamas did is now [well documented](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2023/10/31/whats-in-israels-unreleased-video-of-hamas-attack-00124458). [Einsatzgruppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen) would be horrified.

In bullet-point format:

* Beheading of a Thai person with a garden hoe
* Sheer joy and exhilaration of Hamas and Palestinian civilians with them, at killing kids
* Killing parents in front of their kids
* Making calls to their own parents, boasting of how many jews they'd killed (and their parents being super-proud)
* Piling bodies into a garbage skiff, burning them
* Executing elderly Holocaust survivors
* Immolating people in vehicles
* Rape of captured women

Between October 6th and October 8th,  Hamas turned from a contained terrorist organisation to something akin to what the world thought of Nazis in WW2 -> after years of appeasement and no great success in moderating them, the time had come to eradicate them from existence.

Today, that view stands among almost all of the former Allied nations, and most of the repented Axis ones -> Hamas must no longer exist, appeasement, containment and moderation has failed.

\---

**Since October 8th**

\---

Since October 8th, the world has convulsed with a bunch of well meaning and not so well-meaning people protesting everything. The illogicality of their position is now plain to see because there is a level of myopia they fail to understand, namely: if nothing changes what happens the day after?

Hamas have no interest in giving up power (and why would they)?

Doing nothing means Palestinians live under Hamas and under (a now total) blockade. No outboud workers, no aid allowed in -> Gaza would really become an open-air prison. But one no-one could leave even if they wanted to.

Doing nothing means that generations of Palestinians would be damned to live 100% cut off from the world. Not just the way they have been, but entirely -> no cell service, no Internet. It would be a digital black hole. No banks, no fuel, increasingly dire humanitarian situation (because Hamas does nothing for Palestinians). Probably no UNRWA. It would be civilizational collapse and all those ""50% of Gaza is under 20 years old"" people would have zero hope. Less than zero. They may as well climb back up their mothers' vaginal tracts and attempt to reverse their own birth.

The West has made up its mind, you see. It has done so before, in 1939. Hamas cannot be allowed to exist.

\---

**""We are called a nation of martyrs, and we are proud to sacrifice martyrs.""**

\- Ghazi Hamad

\---

In the West, it has been a century or more since you could raise an army of young men with the call ""you must die for your country"". Modern warfare, in law and in practise is based on preservation of lives.

The job of a Western soldier is not to die for his country, it's to make the enemy die for theirs. No more suicidal charges into the fray with cries of ""God save the King"" or whatever -> that's no longer the Western way. Now we bomb the crap out of a place, and then send in our soldiers in maximum safety. Our soldiers' lives matter.

Ghazi Hamad [wasn't talking about soldiers](https://twitter.com/MEMRIReports/status/1719662664090075199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1719662664090075199%7Ctwgr%5Edaa9c78b1d9c82a6edd0a6288728c34baa635807%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timesofisrael.com%2Fhamas-official-says-group-aims-to-repeat-oct-7-onslaught-many-times-to-destroy-israel%2F) when he said what he said. He was talking about a ""nation of martyrs"". He was talking about Palestinians. Every Palestinian. In that sense, he validated Ben-Gvir and other far-right Israeli clowns who said that every Palestinian should pay for October 7th.

Do Hamas have the right to speak on behalf of all Palestinians in sacrificing their lives for Hamas's cause? Irrespective of the answer, Hamas has not built  civilian bomb shelters, hasn't stockpiled food for civilians, hasn't built [underground hospitals](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231013-from-carpark-to-world-s-largest-underground-hospital-in-30-hours), hasn't gathered a strategic fuel reserve.

If Hamas speaks for Palestinians, then Palestinians are suffering from [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome).

And because the West has decided that Hamas must be eradicated, Hamas has lost the de-facto immunity of being able to use Palestinian civilians as shields as its own shield against Israel.

\---

**Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.**

\- Hamas Charter

\---

It's the 5th of November, 4 weeks since the Hamas attack. Hamas used Combined Arms and a strategy of Total War, while committing something that looks a lot like the war crime of [perfidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy) to establish a war in Gaza.

The Law of Proportionality states that the collateral damage must be proportional to the military value of the target. An organisation promising to obliterate a country, having shown what it can do on October 7th... has lost the right to exist, itself; and... significantly expanded the stakes of ""Proportionality"".

It used to be the case that pro-Palestinians could dismiss Israeli strikes with the claim that Hamas just operated ""toy rockets"" and the strikes weren't proportional. Even if they were right (and they were not), they cannot make the same argument now. Proportionality means that the Hamas terrorist of October 8th, is a far more dangerous figure than the same terrorist of October 6th.

Anyone who still demonstrates for a Free Gaza or a Free Palestine should know: there will be neither until both are first free from Hamas. It can be done now, or in 20 years when Gaza is 5m people.

Some of you pro-Palestinians demonstrators.... might be well meaning people. Maybe you even truly care about lives. But if you don't understand exactly what has happened, and refuse to change your understandings of what must now happen and is happening, you will forever be damned to backing appeasement over ending the intolerable by the only means remaining.",05/11/23 08:22:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17o7fr2/the_western_case_for_the_eradication_of_hamas/,11,15,1178,Oct 7,top,all

1brau71,Hamas Oct 7 Plan,"I understand that palenstine has been getting oppressed for the last few years, and that they will have to do something at some point. However, what was hamas thinking when they decided to attack isreal on oct 7?

In 2020, i read this linkedin article :
 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-elements-every-plan-must-include-christy-lawrence

This article has always stuck with me and helped me make my plans work. If we take the 5 key points from this article (1. A goal  2. Key priorities 3. Critical action steps 4. A list of resources 5.  A list of challenges you expect to face and the strategies needed to overcome them) and compare it to what Hamas has done, it almost felt like hamas leaders got drunk on that day and decided to just attack israel with 0 planning.

Heres what hamas have done done : 

1) knock done a fence 
2)kidnapp some civilans
3)run back to gaza
4)Try and negotiate to exchange the hostages for palenstinian convicted crriminals
5)send missiles
6) get bombed to death 

Now if we use our plan creater to show hamas plan:
Goal : Try and get palenstinian prisoners back

Key priorities: knock down the fence (arguably the hardest part of that whole attack)

Critical action steps: Get civilans and escape

A list of resources : Some bikes a tractor and a load of home made missiles 

A list of challenges you expect to face : Nothing

Does this look like a great plan to you? 

There has been 0 consideration about the consequences of their actions. Now, the civilians are made to face the consequences while the leaders go to Qatar with their 11b net worth.

The point of this post is to show that hamas is incapable of running a country. 0 though has been placed on the civilians, and the goal of that assult was not even to free palenstinians from israel's oppression. Yes israel should not be killing all those civilians, however, there is a real need for a real governing body for the palenstinian when this conflict eventually ends (hopefully)",30/03/24 06:09:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1brau71/hamas_oct_7_plan/,13,154,341,Oct 7,top,all

Tap through a social media feed today, and it might look different from a month ago. There are fewer images, for some, of last night’s concert, a friend’s birthday or that great meal, as users make the choice not to share about their daily lives online. There are more posts, instead, about the thousands of Palestinians and Israelis killed, decimated Gazan villages and the over 200 hostages held by Hamas.  
  
The posts can be violent and evocative, of a bloodied Israeli hostage tossed into a truck, a Palestinian child’s lifeless body under a sheet or a flood of infographics shared an untold number of times.  
  
“My social media feed has become pretty much a war zone,” said Loutje Hoekstra, a 29-year-old artist who posts frequently about the conflict. She has stopped sharing her art or anything about herself because it would feel “two-faced,” she said.

A month into the Israel-Gaza war, an adjacent battle has taken shape online, shifting the norms on platforms where millions spend much of their days. Some users who spoke to The Washington Post said they feel an urgent need to spread awareness about unjust civilian killings and have begun posting multiple times a day despite rarely doing so before Oct. 7.  
  
Others have chosen to stop posting anything — about their daily lives or the conflict — because they worry about angering a friend or colleague by appearing insensitive or saying the wrong thing.

Part uncertainty over what’s appropriate to post, part information war and, some allege, part virtue signaling, experts say it’s a moment in time online that is without precedent.

17yp8m5,Poll taken by Palestinians in Gaza- majority think Oct 7th was launched bc of violations to Aqsa,"“In your opinion what was the main reason for the operation launched by the Palestinian resistance on 7th October?”

To free Palestine: 24.9%

Breaking the siege on the Gaza Strip: 17.7%

Stop the violations of Aqsa: 35.4%

(There were other options, but I only included those with a substantial percentage) 

So I’m assuming they mean Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, but are they all aware that only Muslims are allowed to pray there & it’s patrolled by both the IDF and Jordanian security? It’s also the holiest site in Judaism while it’s the 3rd holiest site for Muslims, but regardless Jews are only permitted to visit and not allowed to pray on the grounds.
Besides this point, do those screaming “free Palestine” across the world even know what Aqsa is? If the Palestinians have said that is the number one reason for Oct 7th then why doesn’t the world actually chant what the Palestinians want the most?

18vn86o,How and why I switched my views,"I grew up around one of the largest communities of Jews in the country. Jewish people were some of my best friends and people that I consider family. Jewish friends and family were there for me in critical times of my life. Gave my young family (I was about 23 with my wife at the time and a 2 year old daughter) a place to stay for a very affordable price as a favor to us.

When my daughter was old enough to go to elementary school we sent her to a Hebrew School (neither her mother or I are Jewish). It was a great school, and her teachers were amazing. Where we lived and I grew up it was much more common to learn Spanish in school as the 2nd language required by the education system. My daughter is half Hispanic. Instead she learned to read and write Hebrew.

The Jews I grew up around and saw in the media shaped how I thought of Israel as a state. I thought Jews that I knew also represented those in Israel. Israel was always to me, similar to other European countries. Ibiza comes to mind.On Oct 7 and the days preceding I was utterly shocked and appalled at the attack on Israel by Hamas and PIJ. In short order I started to see people from my country (US) expressing support for Palestinians and it bewildered me. I started to see tik-tok videos, infographics, and other material expressing support for Palestinians. I was frankly disgusted. One of my first comments on this account was suggesting that the only solution to ""the problem"" was genocide. I thought that. I believed that. I felt that.

I pride myself on always being right. So I started to look up the history of the region. Internally I felt I was 100% correct about Israel being a completely innocent actor in this so I sought out information to validate my views.

Things got complicated quickly. I remember a moment that I was reading some pro pal article and I got so angry that my first reaction was to ""rage quit"" reading it. Then I asked myself, am I looking at this in a biased way, not based on facts, but assumptions and emotions? Am I right? Is Israel representative of the Jews that were part of my life?

The more I read I realized how the one-sided narrative that I believed was much more complicated. I realized that I was wrong. There was a definite point that I as a former vet thought that the bombing would surely end. It didn't. Every single day I saw images of more dead children, more mothers and fathers screaming in pain holding their dead children. You don't need to understand Arabic to understand that.

I saw how Netanyahu didn't want to let humanitarian aid in. Knowing about our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that was completely foreign to me. There was a clear difference between the US and how it conducts war (even when we are being completely f'd up) and what was happening in Gaza. That created a larger rift between my previous assumptions of Israel. I saw soldiers record and do things that if done by a US service member would lead to an immediate Article 15 yet they felt comfortable doing so. I felt I was living a lie.

Anyways for the sake of brevity of this post that is long enough already I will wrap up. Here are some key points I discovered:

1. Palestinians are also by in large indigenous to the land. Genetically they are the cousins of Jews. They both have Levantine ancestry. Today we are able to prove Ashkenazi Jews are tied to the Levant through relation to the Jewish populations that had been there for millennia prior to the Zionist movement. A lot of the change in that specific area was due to conversion. Christians came from Jews and Muslims from both Jews and Christians that were already there.
2. It's apartheid. Not within Israel proper (Muslim Israelis have equal rights under the law) but in the West Bank and to a degree Gaza. You can't tell unless you see it from the ground. I promise you no Westerner would accept living as a West Banker or Gazan. Look up how hard it is to travel from Palestine to Palestine. It makes no sense.
3. The ""offers of a state"" were not all good offers, some were clear insults. You wouldn't really know by only seeing a map. One big issue is the water supply. Today Palestinians in both the WB and Gaza only receive about 13% of the water. That said, it's not wholly Israel that's responsible, Arafat was not a competent statesman. It's complicated though.
4. Everything done and being accused of being done by Hamas has been done by early Zionist terror groups like Lehi, Irgun, and lesser degree Haganah. Yep, including using hospitals, SA, beheading, all of it. [Here is a publication written in 1948.](https://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/pdf/palestine4/Jewish-Atrocities-in-the-Holy-Land.pdf) Nothing is new under the sun.
5. Israel getting what it wanted was greatly due to terrorism. The Lehi, Irgun, and Haganah were successful in driving the British out.
6. Early Zionism had multiple different ideas of what Zionism meant. A healthy chunk of Zionist didn't want to establish a state in the European sense, they were content with living amongst the locals and integrating into the existing culture.
7. In the region intermarriage wasn't uncommon to solidify family ties (ottoman period and even prior) and the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian population had formed their own culture together. Muslims would also celebrate with Jewish holidays with them. All 3 had even fought side by side against invaders. Early Zionist called the Jews there ""Jewish Arabs"" which today is something you probably shouldn't call a Mizrahi or Sephardic Jew to their face.
8. Super importantly, most Israeli's aren't white. Google ""Israeli man"" and ""Palestinian man"" and you find they look the same. Google ""Greek man"" and that is what the west assumes they look.  The apartheid is not based on race like Western people think of it. Side note: *they are both generally some unreasonably sexy ass people. Good lord! Tan skin, pretty eyes, curly hair, fuck. I thought Dominicans were my weakness, the people there are so fine you would consider changing your religion.*
9. Palestinians and Israeli's are only concepts to one another generally. Many Palestinians have never even seen an Jew that wasn't holding a rifle, much less had lunch with them. The same applies the other way. The segregation fuels the hate and lack of understanding between them.

[Here is a good video/lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDugo5S1aMA) by a man that was raised Jewish (he is unitarian) that works to broker the peace process between Israeli's and Palestinians. He has spent considerable time within the West Bank and Israel. He doesn't call for the destruction of Israel. He doesn't hate Palestinians either. I think more human beings who've experienced both first hand should be listened to more.

1b8gl4l,List of Ceasefire Proposals?,"

TLDR: I'm looking for a list of ceasefire proposals since Oct 7. The information I'd love to see is when it was proposed, who mediated, who accepted, who rejected (and why, if known), and what the terms were, and the source of the information. I was hoping Wikipedia would have something I could skim through to get a quick idea of these proposals, but I have not found anything so far. My motivation is that I'd like to be more informed on the topic of ceasefires between Israel and Hamas, but there's so much to scrub through and it's overwhelming. I'm looking for something that's easy to parse.

Example of what I'm expecting. It could be in a bulleted list or in a table:

* Date: \[When first proposed or news shared, or date accepted/rejected\]
* Mediator:
* Acceptance:
* Rejection: (with reason if specified)
* Terms: 
* Source: \[Insert Source\]

This is just filler because of the 1,500 characters minimum limit. I tried to just ask a question before and my original post still got deleted.

Ceasefire proposals show mediation efforts but are often conditional, reflecting security and humanitarian concerns. Acceptance/rejection indicates prioritization of interests. Broader geopolitical context influences terms and negotiation dynamics. Sustained diplomatic efforts crucial for lasting peace.

Ceasefire proposals between Israel and Hamas since October 7 have been characterized by a complex interplay of mediation efforts, strategic calculations, and regional dynamics. While some proposals have led to temporary truces and humanitarian relief, the underlying issues fueling the conflict remain unresolved.  
  
Moving forward, sustained diplomatic efforts, inclusive dialogue, and confidence-building measures are essential to achieving a lasting peace agreement that addresses the security, humanitarian, and political concerns of both Israelis and Palestinians. By closely monitoring ceasefire proposals and analyzing their implications, stakeholders can contribute to building trust, reducing violence, and advancing the prospects for a peaceful resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.",07/03/24 00:44:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1b8gl4l/list_of_ceasefire_proposals/,10,52,315,Oct 7,top,all
18lj3ct,What would Israel look like with Benny Gantz at the helm,"There is alot of disagreement in the sub-reddit  but a common agreement is that the Era of Netanyahu is over. Time of israel released an article that said after the war Benny Gantz would be the favorite in the following election.  I will admit I'm not too familiar with him and curious what others thinks would be the difference under his leadership if any. Of the articles I recently googled didn't leave me to inspired with one of them being journalists involved in oct 7 should be arrested and are terrorists along with another saying that those who throw stones are terrorists. He seems to be pro settlers in the west bank and wants to continued the war front to lebanon after the hamas war. He was also in charge of the military operations Protective edge which is notorious for the mowing of the grass philosophy to deal with the Palestinians. From an initial research i dont feel this is any different than Netanyahu. Overall do the people in this sub-redditt who all agree that netanyahu need to be remove believe this next leader if it does happen to be Benny Gantz is a more positive one ? If not Benny Gantz who do you think in the Government would be the person to replace Netanyahu .

17rjp5a,Confirmation Bias and Intellectual Laziness,"Hi All, Its been one month since the Oct 7 attack and I wanted to bring up something I've noticed from both sides, but is more relevant for the pro-palestinian side. I'll preface this by saying, yes these are my personal anecdotes from participating in this subreddit as well as other subreddits & social media platforms. 

There has been a TON of confirmation bias going on recently. First, let's define what confirmation bias is. [According to Britannica:](https://www.britannica.com/science/confirmation-bias)

>confirmation bias, people’s tendency to process information by looking for, or interpreting, information that is consistent with their existing beliefs. This biased approach to decision making is largely unintentional, and it results in a person ignoring information that is inconsistent with their beliefs. 

Ok, I think we can all agree on this definition. I want to now point out a few examples of how people both in this subreddit and elsewhere are victims of this bias. Let me remind you that this bias may not be conscious one - some people may not even know they are doing it. For my examples, I'm not going to directly quote anyone, but paraphrase responses to information I have seen:

Example 1: ""That is propaganda for X side. I don't believe that""

Example 2: ""I don't trust X source of information""

Example 3: ""You're probably fighting for X, so I don't need to listen to you""

All three of these CAN be examples of confirmation bias - or at the very least, intellectual laziness. When someone provides you with a claim or information, the rational thing to do is review that information, compare it with other sources of information, see if there are inconsistencies with the information, and determine whether it is something that is true or not. Specifically I am talking about claims that can be falsifiable. For example:

""Jewish people have ties to the land that is currently Israel through religion, history, and genetics""

This claim is both falsifiable since it is possible to either prove or disprove, [and is true](https://bje.org.au/knowledge-centre/israel/history/historical-presence/), since there is enough evidence to verify the claim.

Now, back to confirmation bias. When someone presents you with information, responding with any of the examples above is usually textbook confirmation bias. By not even attempting to review the information in the first place because it may goes against an existing belief is confirmation bias. If you do end up reviewing information, but interpret the information to either fit your pre-existing opinions or interpret it in a way that the information was never meant to be interpreted as, it is confirmation bias. So when someone shows you an article, video, picture, recording or other information, try and be aware of how confirmation bias may be affecting you.

Two final things. One, I want to make it clear that skepticism should be promoted. All information should be scrutinized to determine authenticity, truthfulness, missing context, and/or relevance. But the first step to being skeptical is actually reviewing the information. Learning is something that seems to have been thrown out the window and replaced by catchy headlines, inflammatory remarks, and yes, confirmation bias. Second, I understand that everyone has school, jobs, family, and other responsibilities. No one could possibly review the mountains of information surrounding this conflict - but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to stop and learn. If you participate in this subreddit and other places where discussions regarding this conflict take place, take the time to analyze information provided to you, compare it with other reliable sources, and keep an open mind when seeing new information. If you are going to spend the time writing something similar to the 3 examples I provided in response to new information, maybe take a bit more time to instead check how confirmation bias may be affecting your ability to review, process, and interpret information that goes against your existing beliefs.",09/11/23 18:35:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17rjp5a/confirmation_bias_and_intellectual_laziness/,9,7,644,Oct 7,top,all
17a33dm,ELI5 What outcome Hamas was hoping for with this brutal attack?,"Like all decent people, I was completely shocked and horrified by the Oct 7 attack. No words to describe. 

What I don’t understand- there was no outcome where Hamas could “win” in terms of achieving a single strategic or military objective. There was only the absolute certainty that this attack would result in retaliation and horrific casualties to the Palestinian population they claim to serve. 

Terrorism never has strategic value, but often only results in the deaths or imprisonment of the direct perpetrators. This Hamas attack effectively sentenced their own civilian population to death. 

Hoping someone can explain how Hamas thought this attack would have any outcome other than the complete destruction of their military capabilities? 

It is beyond my current comprehension. From my limited perspective, this attack has set back their cause from all angles.

I have read about disrupting the Saudi-Israel deal, but that it seems unbelievable this could justify this level of destruction.",17/10/23 17:02:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17a33dm/eli5_what_outcome_hamas_was_hoping_for_with_this/,8,97,156,Oct 7,top,all
18gotqn,Trying to understand pacifist Jews,"So I was listening to the recent episode of chutzpod! this morning and I really struggled with it. If you're not familiar, it's a podcast co-hosted by someone named Hanna Rosin and a Rabbi named Shira Stutman. They apply Jewish wisdom to daily life issues and dilemmas. They're definitely progressive in terms of their political leanings but they've done some excellent, balanced episodes recently regarding Oct 7 and the war. In the latest episode, Hanna talks about how she's feeling more and more alienated from the Israel she always knew because the Israelis she knows are so fixated on Oct 7 and the hostages and winning the war, and they don't want to hear anything about suffering in Gaza. Every conversation she has with her Israeli mother ends in a fight because she will say something about Gaza or the Palestinians and her mother will get upset.  
  
Anyway, it was difficult to hear an Israeli Jew talk about feeling more alienated from Israel at a time like this and it got me thinking about all the other Jews out there who are in a similar position. The Jews who will say things like, ""Oct 7 was horrible but..."" Jews who have joined the ranks of those calling for a permanent ceasefire, or will say things like ""violence just begets more violence."" I'm really trying to understand this perspective because I think it's important that our community doesn't fracture in a time of crisis.  
  
Personally, I am a liberal diaspora Jew but I don't consider myself progressive. At least not in the way the term is commonly understood now. What I'm struggling with is that I simply don't agree with pacifism as a philosophy - I don't like war and I think it should be avoided as much as possible, but I absolutely think war is sometimes necessary. I think pacifism is based on a naive and idealistic view of the world that is simply false: that everyone could get along peacefully if we just talked more and demonstrated mutual respect. I believe that evil exists, and that violent hatred doesn't always grow out of a legitimate gripe. And I see Oct 7 as a manifestation of that irrational violent hatred.  
  
So I guess my question is this: For those of you speak out against Israel's war, why? What are you hoping will ultimately happen?",12/12/23 15:45:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18gotqn/trying_to_understand_pacifist_jews/,10,83,394,Oct 7,top,all

That said Hamas launched an absolutely heinous terror attack on October 7th. Was America justified in invading Afghanistan after 9/11 and hunting down Osama Bin Laden? I think so. October 7th is Israel’s 9/11. Therefore I have an idea.

The leaders of Hamas all live in luxury homes in Iran. We know who most of them are and where they live. If all of the Muslims around the world care so much about Palestine how about we call for the leaders of Hamas to surrender themselves to Israel. In exchange Israel will leave Gaza. If all of the top Taliban leaders surrendered themselves it would have been pretty tough to justify 20 years in Afghanistan. If the orchestrators of Oct 7 surrender; Israel looses its justification for bombing the hospitals sheltering some of them. I want to see Muslims around the world call for the leaders of Hamas to turn themselves in, it could save tens of thousands of lives.

17q8juk,A 2-State Solution Proposal,"Once the dust settles, there will be a good opportunity to jumpstart peace talks between Palestinians and Israel.  
There will be many who will disagree, demand retribution, revenge, justice, but most will agree that no matter what toll this war took on both sides, there needs to be an end to the bloodshed.  
The only way to put an end to it is through a lengthy process of reconciliation.  


After the war is over there will be fewer radical forces to sabotage the peace process, albeit fewer only on one side of the negotiating table.  
  
I think most will agree that a solution to this conflict will require all sides to make significant compromises.  
  
Here is a draft proposal:  
  
Israel:  
1. Withdraw from most of the west bank, except for major settlements. Settlers will be compensated or resettled within Israel.  
2. Provide Palestinians with land from Israeli territory equivalent to the land in the west bank that will remain under Israeli control, including land that amounts to roads/infrastructure that are required for the remaining settlements.  
3. Withdraw from Eastern Jerusalem.  
4. Concede some land adjacent to Gaza strip to Palestinians. I am a bit partial about this, but some reasoning for this is as follows:  
4.1. I may be wrong, but some of the villages near the Gaza strip will never recover from Oct 7 and will be left abandoned for good. Israelis may not wish to settle near the Gaza strip again for fear of future attacks like these.  
4.2. Token of goodwill that could go a long way towards having the other side agreeing to the proposal.   
4.3. Compensation for lost land during the 1948 expulsion & a place for Palestinian refugees to resettle to be used in right of return claims (see point 11).  
5. Release all Palestinian prisoners. Can be done in stages, where the ones who committed severe crimes are released after Palestinian militant factions are dismantled and an adequeate Palestinian police force is installed.  
6. Dismantle the wall in the west bank that is on Palestinian territory. Any wall erected in the future should be on Israeli territory.  
7. Provide permanent passage between Gaza strip and west bank without checkpoints. This can be either a tunnel or a bridge (preferably latter) or fenced roads with multi-level intersection where Israeli and Palestinian roads intersect.  
8. Help Palestinians rebuild the Gaza strip.  
9. Announce a statutory holiday - reconciliation/peace day, shared with the Palestinians.  
10. Formally recognize the new Palestinian state and apologize for past transgressions (expulsion of Arabs, Deir Yassin massacre, etc.)  
11. Open a formal judicial process for Palestinian refugees' right of return. This may take years and most may not be able to return to residences of their ancestors, but the justice department can see to it that they are adequately compensated, similar to the compensation process that exists in EU countries for Jews who were expelled during WWII. These refugees could become Israeli citizens if they  win the claim. As it could take years for all claims to be heard and verdict reached, this would not result in a significant demographical shift that would threaten the existence of the state of Israel. If necessary, annual immigration quotas could be introduced.  
12. Remove bias from school textbooks and establish an education program in cooperation with Palestine's ministry of education to start joint programs that promote tolerance, diversity for students on both sides.  
  
Some may argue that Israel will need to give up more than others, but I believe that ultimately the benefits will outweigh the drawbacks, primarily in improving security and safety. 

Some may also argue that a state of Palestine will pose a grave risk to Israel as this will allow radical militants to launch rockets from the west bank and into Israel or strengthen militarily then attack Israel with an army. That could very well be true. With no Israeli control on the borders with Egypt and Jordan, rockets and other military equipment could be smuggled into Gaza strip and the west bank from Iran or its proxies and radical factions could rise and continue to wage war against Israel. Israeli and Palestinian governments with the aid of US and other countries would need to move swiftly to help the Palestinian authorities to establish a strong policing force that will prevent radicals from acting.  
  
Palestine:  
1. Formally recognize the state of Israel and announce an end to the Palestinian struggle.  
2. Replace Naqba with reconciliation/peace day.  
3. Allow Palestinian refugees to immigrate and settle in the new state of Palestine.  
4. Dismantle and ban all armed militant groups and replace them with a united defence force.  
5. Establish a democratic state with a judicial court system, rule of law, police force and work towards reducing violence, incitement and corruption, preventing illegal smuggling of weapons, building of tunnels and conducting any hostile military activity.  
6. Same as Israel step 12.

  
Jordan:  
1. Gift some territory on the east bank of the river Jordan to the state of Palestine. Compensate land owners accordingly.  
2. Allow Palestinian refugees in Jordan to move to the state of Palestine.  
  
Egypt:  
1. Gift some territory in eastern Sinai adjacent to the Gaza strip to Palestinians.  
  
US, UN, EU and other world countries::  
1. Provide financial and/or military aid to Egypt, Jordan in exchange for their part in the peace process.  
2. Provide financial aid to Israel to ease the financial burden of compensating Palestinians and settlers.  
3. Provide financial aid to Palestine to help them transition into a lawful, democratic state and help with the refugee resettlement.  
  
There are several reasons why I think Jordan and Egypt should take an active part in the establishment of the state of Palestine:  
1. US has been providing substantial financial aid to both countries. They can benefit from further US aid.  
2. Both countries were partially responsible for Palestinian loss of territory in the 1948 war and the 1967 war and for conceding the territory to Israel.  
3. Both countries will share a border with the future state of Palestine and would benefit from good relations with the new state.

4. Jordan has a large Palestinian population that has at times been at odds with the government of Jordan. Gifting land to Palestinians will go a long way towards putting an end to destabilizing activity within Jordan.  
  
Here are the reasons why the world should provide financial incentives:  
1. Many countries would like to see the region stabilize and would benefit from it.  
2. Some countries are eager to normalize ties with Israel for trade and various types of co-operation.  
3. Much of aid given to Gaza and Palestinians is lost to recurring conflicts. The aid would finally have a long lasting positive effect.   
  
I do not think that a 1-state solution is feasible for various reasons, at least at this point in time.  
When hatred and animosity is almost entirely gone on both sides and co-existence becomes possible, the 2 states can merge and work out the nuances of preserving democratic rule of law, religious institutions, right of return, and more.   
  
I think that most Israeli governments will reject this kind of proposal, but maybe something between this and the Arab Peace initiative could eventually work.

**Before anyone comes at me:** I condemn all forms of hate and discrimination. I condemn all forms of racism and bigotry. I condemn antisemitism and islamophobia. I condemn the horrific terrorist attacks against civilians in Israel on Oct. 7th, and I really really do feel for the all who were affected by the attack and who lost their loved ones that day. I have been staying up to date with the confirmed deaths on both sides and I have been actively trying to found out more details of what happened that day. Hamas attacked \~30 different locations and it lasted a very long time. People might not have been raped across the board, but it does not mean that rape did not happen and the debate should really just end there. I am truly sorry to those who felt that the attack was being downplayed or justified. I also condemn the military occupation of Palestinian people and the tragic loss of civilian life in Gaza. It breaks my heart to see people saying ""I am sick of seeing Palestinian kids..."" I just don't know what happened to our humanity, our compassion for one another. I condemn state sanctioned settler violence against Palestinians. I condemn forced evictions of Palestinian families from their homes. I condemn the targeted killing of journalists. I condemn all forms of terrorism, including extremist terrorism such as that of hamas and state organized terrorism such as that of the Israeli government. 

I know there are good people on here. We have a collective responsibility to condemn terrorism, antisemitism, and islamophobia while simultaneously recognizing the responsibility of the Israeli government in all of this. History didn't start on Oct. 7 and these testimonies from former IDF soldiers prove what we have been saying all along - terrorism does not exist in a vacuum.

1b4t7db,Bias in fact checking websites,"There is a pervasive misconception about fact checking websites that they are unbiased and neutral. 

This couldn't be further from the truth.  Almost every source is going to have bias because every site is run by people not robots.  Sometimes, sites mitigate this by having articles looked over by people who view the world with different political perspectives.  This is a great way to reach a neutral point, but being neutral or in the middle doesn't always mean that one is correct either. 

Now, there is nothing wrong with using fact checking websites and bias doesn't inherently mean one is wrong. However, a bias can lead to a wrong conclusion or misrepresentation of facts. 

*Snopes*

The most egregious and obvious offender has been Nur Ibrahim over at Snopes. Ibrahim has been responsible for a lot of the coverage around the conflict. 

Before we get into Ibrahim, Snopes starts off with the following snippet in every single article about the conflict: 

>The protracted, often bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict exploded into a hot war on Oct. 7, 2023, when the militant Palestinian group Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel and Israel retaliated by bombarding the Gaza Strip. More than 20,000 people, the vast majority of them Palestinians, were reportedly killed during the first two months of the war alone. The violence is driven by mutual hostilities and territorial ambitions dating back more than a century. 

Right off the bat, Snopes takes the Hamas run Gaza's ministry of health casualty numbers at face value. As other posts have documented and articulated, Hamas is not reliable in their casualty numbers and they inflate the number of women and children killed. Then, Snopes says that the conflict is due to ""territorial ambitions dating back more than a century."" This line puts the blame on Israel and plays into the whole ""October 7th didn't happen in a vacuum"" reasoning, which has been most often used to excuse Hamas for their atrocities. No, Hamas didn't attack over any ""occupation"" or ""stolen land""; they attacked because they are a bunch of violent jihadists who will find any reason to slaughter Jews. 

Personally, I blame [Ibrahim](https://www.snopes.com/news/2023/10/12/40-israeli-babies-beheaded-by-hamas/) for the confusion around the dead baby story. In her article, she first says: 

>As we looked into the claim, we found contradictory reports from journalists and Israeli army officials, and almost no independent corroborations of the alleged war crime, leading to concerns among fact-checkers that such a claim may be premature or unsubstantiated.

She first claims it wasn't true at the top of the article. 

The rest of the article tries to downplay Hamas, until you run into the independently verified pathology report and the December 4th correction way down at the bottom of the article: 

> Dr. Chen Kugel, the head of the \[Israel's National Center of Forensic Medicine\], said the victims ranged from 3 months to 80 or 90 years old. He said many bodies, including those of babies, were without heads. When asked if they were decapitated, he said yes.  
>  
>On Dec. 4, 2023, Haaretz published a report it claimed detailed the circumstances of ""most"" child deaths at the hands of Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023. None of those child deaths explicitly mentioned beheadings, though the report said of all killings: ""Hamas terrorists did desecrate corpses during the massacre, especially the bodies of soldiers. There were also beheadings and cases of dismemberment.""

So, yes. There were decapitated babies and Ibrahim is a liar and a Hamas apologist. Unfortunately, Ibrahim has not relented in her blaming of Israel and downplaying Hamas in other articles, but this post would get too long if it focused on Ibrahim. 

*Politifact*

Politifact spends a lot of time trying to debunk Trump and conservative news outlets, but they mostly go for really low hanging fruit surrounding the conflict. Occasionally, they will fall for Palestinian propaganda. 

[Take this article](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/nov/30/newsmax/a-video-shows-a-palestinian-influencer-not-a-crisi/) saying Saleh Aljafarawi is not a crisis actor and downplaying claims about Pallywood.  They downplay Aljafarawi by saying he is just a social media influencer.  They say: 

>PolitiFact’s review of Aljafarawi’s social media accounts and background did not reveal evidence of him being a ""crisis actor"" or faking the scene at the hospital. 

Pallywood refers to how Palestinians will stage scenes for western consumption to play upon common sympathies, and my guess is that politifact treats claims about crisis actors as ""alt-right"". 

Who is Saleh Aljafarawi? [Saleh Aljafarawi, aka MrFAFO](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/mr-fafo-real-liel-leibovitz),  is the Palestinian equivalent to [Johnny Sins](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1167333-johnny-sins) (this goes to KnowYourMeme, not anything else). He's the guy you see in all the videos, and there is nothing he can't do. You can look at some of his work here:

Long story short, Palestinians do engage in [media manipulation](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/pallywood-ahli-hospital) and the rest of you fall for it. No, it's not a conspiracy theory, it's intentional to get you to hate Israel.  Palestinians have been doing this since the second Intifada, and it's an effective tactic to play upon your heartstrings. This isn't to say that all videos are staged, but you should be a little skeptical and try to figure out if something is Hamas agitprop first. 

*MediaBiasFactCheck*

Personally, I use [HonestReporting](https://honestreporting.com/) and [CAMERA](https://www.camera.org/) for fact checking. I trust these two sites because they have a greater familiarity with the conflict and have been covering media bias on Israel for a while now. They aren't generalists like Snopes and Politifact who aren't familiar with the intricacies and nuances with Israel. 

Unfortunately, [MediaBiasFactCheck](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/honest-reporting/) has labeled HonestReporting as: 

>Overall, we rate HonestReporting Right-Center Biased based on support for right-leaning nationalist political parties. We also rate them as Mostly Factual rather than High due to the promotion of nationalist propaganda.

And their claim of nationalist propaganda comes from this reasoning: 

>Editorially, they hold pro-Israel nationalist positions in favor of [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://honestreporting.com/ibn-20203009-hezbollah-covid-19-antisemitism/) and the current nationalist parties. Some might call them a propaganda source.

And the link is talking about how Netanyahu is highlighting Hezbollah weapons depots in Lebanon. Really? How is that nationalist propaganda? There is nothing wrong with being pro-Israel, but apparently MediaBiasFactCheck thinks so. 

MediaBiasFactCheck is a little more favorable to [CAMERA](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/camera-committee-for-accuracy-in-middle-east-reporting-and-analysis/), but they tell you that: 

>Critics of CAMERA claim that it is an ‘[extreme Israel advocacy group](https://forward.com/opinion/435453/how-trumps-education-department-is-weaponizing-anti-semitism-and/)’ aligned with hawkish right-wing viewpoints. In general, they frequently report negatively on left-leaning media that does not fully support Israel, such as [THE WASHINGTON POST BURIES THE TRUTH ABOUT PALESTINIAN TERRORISM](https://www.camera.org/article/the-washington-post-buries-the-truth-about-palestinian-terrorism/), and this [ROLLING STONE JUMPS ON PRO-TERRORIST BANDWAGON](https://www.camera.org/article/rolling-stone-jumps-on-pro-terrorist-bandwagon/).

Where they link to a Forward op-ed arguing that claims of antisemitism are being used to silence criticism of Israel, and articles detailing bias in the WaPo and Rolling Stone. 

Where else have we heard about advocacy for Israel being extreme and antisemitism being used to silence criticism? Well, right here on this sub and from all the Israel haters.  This makes me suspicious that there is an Israel hater plant at MediaBiasFactCheck. This organization could be a little more transparent on where D. Van Zandt, the author of these articles, stands with respect to the conflict. 

*The Takeaway*

None of this should stop you from using fact-checking websites, but you should still take these authors with a grain of salt.  However, just because these sites have labeled themselves as arbiters of the truth, doesn't actually mean that they are arbiters of the truth. 

If you want to learn more about media bias surrounding the conflict, I would highly suggest reading ""[David & Goliath: The explosive inside story of media bias in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict](https://www.amazon.com/David-Goliath-explosive-Israeli-Palestinian-conflict-ebook/dp/B00789YLHO/ref=sr_1_3?crid=18KJ9OCQIBAK8&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xcaCti11SiOdXBXyKyowKJyR9yyKdRzOms50_cyPz3NKj7z58zr08SsAoti5g7yBkTg5Rc4PahyuTUxscRrWGGVmKOhys7aAEn8HZTmjMXvkltWnCFm5jcFJOQ9KJpXR.eWf0F_qGjkWfNSRGFK578oufVcHf4lCUuCcxcwSGrtg&dib_tag=se&keywords=Shraga+Simmons&qid=1709399432&sprefix=shraga+simmons%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-3)"" by Shraga Simmons.

18409jd,"""Miracle"": Muslim Men in Gaza Seek Christ After Over 200 Dream of Jesus on Same Night - Report","About a month before the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack, Assemblies of God News reported that Muslims around the world were dreaming of Jesus and converting to Christianity at an unprecedented rate.  
  
In a recent Facebook post, Licona said he received a report from “underground Christian ministries” in the Middle East that detailed the miraculous conversions.  “Over the past two days, we have ministered to hundreds of fathers who have lost most, if not all, of their children in the war. As we moved these men to safety, we fed them, washed their clothes, and began to read the Bible to them — sharing the way of peace through Jesus.  
  
“Then, a big miracle happened. Last night, Jesus appeared to more than 200 of them in their dreams! They have come back to us to learn more from God’s Word and are asking how to follow Jesus,” the report said.

17mezeg,An Egyptian proposal to stop the war and establish a Palestinian state,"Some creative ideas from Abderahman Salaheldin, an experienced Egyptian diplomat.  I expected to find the usual tired language blaming Israel for the 1948 displacement of the Palestinians and the occupation, but instead I found:

* Ceasefire, multinational force occupies Gaza and disarms Hamas
* Reconstruction and rehabilitation of Gaza over a multiyear transitional period
* Territorial swaps to expand Gaza into the Negev to compensate for the major Israeli settlements in the WB to be annexed by Israel.  This is in line with what was proposed in the Taba talks of 2001. 
* Peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians and Arab countries

My take: the territorial swap to expand Gaza in exchange for the WB settlements is a creative one and has merit.  My main concern is that Israel must have guarantees that Gaza 2.0 be de-Hamasified and the Hamas commanders and militants/terrorists (choose your term) that carried out the attacks of Oct 7 be removed from Gaza - say expelled to Iran.  The Gaza administrative functionaries can stay if they renounce allegiance to Hamas.

17mykzh,Hassan Nazrallah: Hezbollah will not be opening a second front in the war,"What is clear from today’s speech is that Hezbollah has been successfully deterred by Israel and the US. He painted it as not a war between Israel and Iran or Israel and Hezbollah, but the Palestinians and Israel. 

As such it is clear that Hezbollah is letting Gaza fall to Israel, and preparing for the main mode of conflict to exist in the North. This is a strategic decision by Iran. Oct 7 has now been a suicide attack for Hamas, and Iran will be letting it go. 

The question now is whether Israel will want to eliminate Hezbollah entirely after Gaza has been resolved. They could do so now if they wanted to.

Hamas, albeit privately, will interpret this as abandonment by Iran. ",03/11/23 16:10:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17mykzh/hassan_nazrallah_hezbollah_will_not_be_opening_a/,5,11,124,Oct 7,top,all
17emqda,DC police arrest 500 activists at US Capitol demanding ceasefire in Gaza,"[https://therealnews.com/dc-police-arrest-500-activists-at-us-capitol-demanding-ceasefire-in-gaza](https://therealnews.com/dc-police-arrest-500-activists-at-us-capitol-demanding-ceasefire-in-gaza)

On Oct. 18, organizers say 500 people, mostly Jewish activists, were arrested in Washington, DC, as they carried out a sit-in inside a Capitol office building to demand an immediate ceasefire in the besieged and blockaded Gaza Strip.   
“We are here, very simply, to say no to genocide, to say an end to mass murder, to say an end to keeping water, food, power, and medical care away from people,” Rabbi Linda Holtzman told The Real News prior to her arrest inside the Capitol’s Cannon House Office Building.   
Join thousands of others who rely on our journalism to navigate complex issues, uncover hidden truths, and challenge the status quo with our free newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox twice a week:  
Holtzman and a dozen other Jewish rabbis led the civil disobedience action as thousands rallied outside to demand an end to the US-backed Israeli assault on Gaza. Many held signs that read “Jews say: Ceasefire Now,” and “No to war, no to apartheid.” Gaza’s 2.2 million residents face a mounting death toll from a relentless  bombing campaign by Israeli forces, which have cut off access to food, water, and electricity in retaliation for the Oct. 7 Hamas cross-border attack that killed over 1,400 Israelis.   
As of Oct. 18, 3,478 Palestinians have been killed and 12,000 wounded by Israel’s assault, including reports of 471 killed on Oct. 17 in the bombing of a Gaza hospital. The United Nations has urged Israel to lift its humanitarian blockade cutting access to power, water, food, and medical supplies. Israel ordered one million Gaza residents to relocate to the south ahead of a possible ground invasion.   
“It is a genocide, and I say that with the full knowledge of all that means to our people, and we are here to end it now,” said Stephanie Fox, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, which organized the action.  
Organizers say 500 people, mostly Jewish activists, were arrested during an Oct. 18 sit-in to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

The protest took place as US President Joe Biden traveled to Israel to show support for its ongoing attack on Gaza, and one day after the bombing of al-Ahli Hospital, which, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, killing hundreds of women, children, and medical personnel. Palestinians accused Israel of the attack but Biden echoed Israel’s claim that the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad was responsible for the attack. Responsibility remains disputed.   
During his visit, Biden vowed to send Israel additional military aid and sought to broker a deal to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, but activists said the US must stop supporting and try to end Israel’s attacks.  
“It’s crystal clear. We’re saying to Biden as he’s there in Israel: demand an immediate ceasefire,”  said Holtzman. “We are here to say the United States of America: You can’t keep funding a genocide.”  
Starting at noon, gathered  at the National Mall, speakers led chants of “No more weapons, no more war, a ceasefire is what we are calling for,” and urged Congress to support a resolution introduced on Monday by Reps. Cori Bush (D-MO) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for an immediate ceasefire.  Both representatives addressed the crowd.  
Tlaib, the sole Palestinian-American member of Congress, criticized her colleagues for rejecting her call for an immediate end to hostilities. “They’re saying, ‘Not yet. Maybe next week. Maybe in a couple of days.’ How many have to die?” Talib asked.   
Tlaib also criticized the White House, which has so far rejected calls for a ceasefire, and last week said those demands were “repugnant” and “disgraceful.”  
“I want \[President Biden\] to know, as a Palestinian American \[and of the\] Muslim faith, I’m not going to forget this. And I think a lot of people are not going to forget this,” Tlaib said.  
Bush said a ceasefire is the only way to stop the cycle of bloodshed in Israel and Palestine. “Violence, we know, will never bring peace. Violence only leads to more violence,” she said. “We must stand on the side of humanity. We must stand on the side of justice. We must stand on the side of equality. We must stand on the side of self-determination.”  
Activists urged the Biden administration to hold Israel accountable for its actions.   
“President Biden has one job when he’s talking to Netanyahu, which is to say ceasefire now. We already funded Israeli apartheid at $4 billion a year—there they’re discussing $10 billion more in this horrifying march of war, violence and death.” said Fox.  
“What we’re seeing is that as progressives see more clearly what is happening in Gaza, the demand for ceasefire is rapidly becoming more normalized, and it’s coming from the progressive left of the party.”  
Beth Miller, Jewish Voice for Peace Political Director  
Congress has pledged additional military support to Israel, which has already set to receive over $3.8 billion this year. Israel remains a top recipient of US military aid, which has totaled $158 billion since World War II, while it has continued to expand settlements on Palestinian land in the Occupied West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law. The current humanitarian crisis is rooted in the displacement of Palestinian communities both in 1948 and an ongoing Israeli military occupation since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.  
“For 75 years, the State of Israel has built and enacted a system of apartheid that privileges Jewish Israelis over Palestinians indigenous to the land,” said Fox. “Palestinians live with less rights and and less freedom simply because they are not Jewish. And human rights experts …agree that it meets the definitions under international law of apartheid.”  
Criticism over the US’s role in the conflict was echoed on Wednesday by a high-ranking State Department official who resigned over the US’s weapons sales to Israel.  
“I believe to the core of my soul that the response Israel is taking, and with it the American support both for that response, and for the status quo of the occupation,” Josh Paul, a former director at the State Department, wrote in a Linkedin post, “will only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people.”  
At the rally, speakers also accused politicians of stoking Islamophobia by dehumanizing Palestinians, noting the death of six-year-old Palestinian-American Wadea Al Fayoume, who was stabbed to death the previous Saturday because he was Muslim, police say.   
“Our poor six-year-old baby—my child is the same age. There is just no excuse for the kind of utter cruelty and dehumanization that is being drummed up by our very politicians. And that’s what we’re here to say no to,” said Fox.  
The conflict’s growing death toll and a growing anti-war movement is turning US public opinion against the conflict, Jewish activists said. Two days earlier, at another protest, over 30 were arrested after hundreds of Jews led by the group If Not Now surrounded and blockaded the White House to demand a ceasefire.  
Congressional support for a ceasefire remains small, but growing. On Wednesday, Congressional Progressive Chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal was among the Democratic lawmakers who signed on to calls for an immediate ceasefire, noted JVP’s political director, Beth Miller.   
“What we’re seeing is that as progressives see more clearly what is happening in Gaza, the demand for ceasefire is rapidly becoming more normalized, and it’s coming from the progressive left of the party,” said Miller. “We anticipate that that will only grow, and the more and more we make it clear, by showing up en masse on the Capitol like this, that this is what their voters want and demand.”  
Holtzman said she and other Jewish protesters were compelled to attend the rally and risk arrest to call for a ceasefire because of the atrocities experienced by their own families.   
“I grew up in a family where, in my past, my grandmother lost several siblings in the Holocaust because of people who were ready to commit a genocide. I cannot possibly allow in my name that to ever happen again,” said Holtzman.

17a6sl2,Hamas says it will release civilian hostages if Israel stops Gaza strikes; hospital death toll 500,"A senior Hamas armed commander was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, Hamas’ armed wing Izz el-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades said Tuesday on Telegram, according to a Google translation. The Israeli air force later confirmed the killing.  
  
Ayman Nofal was a member of the General Military Council and commander of the Central Brigade in the al-Qassam Brigades, the Palestinian militant group said.  
  
The Israeli military has said that the next steps of its campaign against Palestinian militant group Hamas need not be a long-anticipated ground incursion.  
  
“We are preparing for the next stages of war. We haven’t said what they will be. Everybody’s talking about the ground offensive. It might be something different,” a spokesperson said.  
  
Israel is on its 11th day of an aerial bombardment campaign of the Gaza Strip, over which it has ordered a total siege, cutting off water, food and electricity supplies to a population of 2 million people.  
  
The siege, which human rights groups have criticized for breaking humanitarian law, comes in response to a brutal terrorist attack by Hamas on Oct. 7. The death toll from the conflict so far has risen to at least 1,400 people killed in Israel and more than 2,700 people killed in Gaza. The Israeli government says that Hamas is holding at least 199 hostages kidnapped from Israel.  
  
Israel’s Gaza evacuation order could amount to a crime of “forcible transfer” in breach of international law, according to a spokesperson for the U.N. human rights office.

Today the ICJ ruled their preliminary ruling I believe and basically found south africa case to be filled with merit and will continue the court hearing and at the meantime is telling Israel to "" take steps to prevent genocide immediately"". 

In general the south African side presented a better case than the israel attorneys. I will link an article below that discusses the failure in a legal sense by the Israeli side.

https://theintercept.com/2024/01/12/icj-israel-genocide/

First of all as a person that is on the palestinian side while admitting to the tragedy of Oct 7 I will admit this ruling doesn't really matter to me. One of the main reasons is that I don't want to be a hypocrite if the ruling was anti palestinian it would not have changed my mind. I'm sure many pro Israelis probably feel the way with this judgements that goes against them.

Some  positive, while this might not bring immediate changes. , international pressure against Israel by countries Let's say France will increase and diplomatic relationship and trade will be impacted.  This also comes as a partial win to Yemen as the houthis point is their action is to go prevent a genocide, and are impacting trade in compliance of international law, this puts the U.K and the U.S in a terrible spot and best case scenario have to revoke labeling yeman as a terrorist group while still coming them and protecting their ship but this is probably unlikely. 

What does this mean for Israel and the IDF not much, this government is unpopular domestically and internationally and have said they will proceed no matter what. They will probably continue to accepting the short term and long term negative outcomes that will happen to them and their citizens. 

At the current moment this is obviously a win but not one that will address the immediate needs of those in gaza. Overall I don't like using the term genocide, in a legal setting it applies but colloquially people on this sub-reddit will just roll their eyes saying the famine is hamas fault and the death date is only thirty thousand. I think something that is stronger to defend which why i am pro palestine is that we are witnessing an effort of ethnic cleansing with multiple mass casualties death and collective punishment being imparted on citizens. To me to argue against those three points would impart  a person that is bias and just filled with thoughts of revenge or has no good will to actually discuss what is actually happening.  

In conclusion, this is a win for those on the palestinian side but not one in the short term. I hope I am wrong but it seems unlikely the IDF will change any of their actions, in a few years If the ICJ actually rules on it , the damage would have all been conflicted to those in gaza.",26/01/24 16:56:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1abn0gz/icj_court_finds_genocide_risk/,5,497,484,Oct 7,top,all
17phjzf,What should Israel do to avoid civilian casualties? (Try to be objective),"It can be hard to be objective given the scale of human suffering in Israel and Palestine right now. I think despite the various positions people are taking right now about the conflict, most/all of us do not delight in seeing civilians of any country suffer.

That said, how do people suggest Israel respond after Oct 7, realistically speaking:

1. Do nothing, since there will be civilian casualties in Gaza in any military response. Give in to whatever the terrorists demand and hope Hamas releases hostages. Reinforce the Gaza border and hope Hamas doesn't attempt an Oct 7th-style attack again.

2. Do not use any bombs in Gaza, since Hamas deliberately builds up military presence in or near civilian infrastructure, and bombs are unable to distinguish between civilians and terrorists. Send in IDF troops instead, and accept that IDF losses will be much higher to compensate for the lack of target-softening that bombing campaigns are meant to achieve.

3. Do what they (Israel) are doing right now.

4. Other. (Note that a clear majority of Palestinians do not support a two-state solution, similarly a clear majority of Israelis do not either).

WHEN THE MILITANT group Hamas launched a devastating surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, some fighters breached the country’s defenses in motorized paragliders. Footage of this assault from the air spread widely with the first reports of war — particularly videos of gliders descending on the Israeli music festival Supernova, where 260 attendees were killed and dozens more abducted. In the following days, photos and illustrations of Hamas forces coasting by wing became highly charged, controversial symbols: an emblem of Palestinian resistance to some, a glorification of terrorism to others.  
  
But as the Chicago chapter of Black Lives Matter deleted an ill-advised tweet featuring the image of a paraglider, protesters at a pro-Palestine rally in London sparked outrage by wearing photos of the Hamas paragliders, and singer Alicia Keys clarified that a reference to paragliding on her Instagram account had nothing to do with the conflict, far-right trolls were appropriating the meme for themselves. A new report from Israel-based online trust and safety company ActiveFence has found that openly antisemitic paraglider art, some of it AI-generated, is proliferating in extremist forums as well as mainstream social platforms.",25/10/23 20:55:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17geu5q/hailey_lujan_the_military_psyop_egirl_is_selling/,6,7,238,Oct 7,top,all
17wudd0,Israeli Politics and who is supporting Bibi?,"Hi all. I want to discuss this topic to better understand the current political landscape in Israel. For reference I'm Jewish Canadian and have been to Israel once. Got to visit Tel Aviv & Jerusalem, lived in a Kibbutz for a few days, and stayed at a Bedouin camp. When I was there, it was more about learning the culture and talking to the people in Israel - which was great, but very little was discussed about politics. So that is my question, mainly towards Israelis but I'm happy to hear from others about their opinions.

To preface, [Bibi and the Likud party won the latest election in 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Israeli_legislative_election) with 23.41% of the vote - A sizable margin compared to Lapid who only got 17.78% of the vote. I assume most Israelis are familiar with his corruption charges, his encouragement for expanding WB settlements and his disregard for Israeli violence both in the WB and East Jerusalem. I had been keeping an eye on the Judicial reform protests that had been occuring prior to Oct 7, and there seemed to be quite a lot of people who were fighting against these reforms. [Looking at the data from 2017](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2017/01/03/no-consensus-among-israeli-jews-about-settlements-impact-on-security/), it seems like there is increasing support for the WB settlements over the years just based on the security argument, but it is clear that settlements are supported by the majority of the political right.

From what I have seen on this sub, from my discussions with a few Israelis both in Israel and online, and from my discussions with diaspora Jews, is seems that most strongly dislike Netanyahu and his settlement policy in the WB.

So I have a few questions to better understand the political landscape in Israel and maybe see what people have as a solution to improving relations with the Palestinians politically. Who are Bibi's supporters? Clearly the ""right"", but who actually are these people, and what do they stand for? How do you feel the political climate and the opinions of Bibi have changed over the last decade, as well as before and after Oct 7? Why has Bibi been able to evade prosecution from his corruption charges? Even in the US, we're able to force Trump into a court to prosecute him for his alleged crimes. Do you think Lapid is a better choice for Israel, and why is there such a big majority voting for right-wing, nationalist political parties? Definitely a lot of questions, but I'd love to learn some things about this and understand to average Israeli's stance (or I guess the average Israeli redditor's stance since it seems more liberal in here than what the national polls show) on the political landscape and Bibi.

Cheers!",16/11/23 18:51:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17wudd0/israeli_politics_and_who_is_supporting_bibi/,3,11,452,Oct 7,top,all
17r6z7t,Look beyond Iran,"After 9/11, I believe the US and countries affected by terrorism, lost an opportunity to hit at the sources of terror by going after Iraq, rather than those financing terror, or countries supporting it (Pakistan, not Afghanistan, which was a barely functioning state).

After 7 Oct, I see a similar tendency to go after Iran, on the assumption that it was solely Iran that was behind Hamas's actions. It suits the current Israeli govt and allows the US govt to show that it isn't soft on Iran. Certainly Iran has fished in troubled waters and provided arms, training etc, to Hamas but it isn't only them. Military action against Iran may be a dangerous escalation.

Qatar has been the biggest funder of Hamas. Turkey is probably the biggest ideological supporter of Hamas (far more than Shia Iran) - President Erdogan's party is an affiliate of the same Muslim brotherhood that Hamas is based on. Turkey has made statements against Israel which seem close to a declaration of war.

Both countries are US allies, Turkey is a member of NATO. Unless their support stops, permanently, I see this problem festering, because as long as there is financing and Ideological support, Hamas will thrive. It may be better to act against all states in the region that support Hamas.   
This is something I feel strongly about as terrorist financing and ideological support is as bad as a terrorist act. ",09/11/23 06:37:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17r6z7t/look_beyond_iran/,4,5,237,Oct 7,top,all

Israeli authorities are investigating claims by U.S. researchers that some investors may have known in advance of a Hamas plan to attack Israel on Oct. 7 and used that information to profit from Israeli securities.

17yalr2,Common Israeli Talking Points,"I'm aware this is a mostly Zionist sub, so I don't imagine the majority will welcome this post. But here it is. Generic Israeli talking points, debunked one by one. Let's see if anyone has anything new to say.

&#x200B;

* **The conflict is so complicated and you don't truly understand it.**

This is usually followed by a detail that makes Israel out to be a fair and innocent party, trying just to do good and defend itself. But in short, the conflict is not complicated. All of its small details may be complex.

However, even in those small details, you can see evidence over and over of Israeli lies and propaganda. For example, did you know that [Israel purposefully attacked a United States communications vessel](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA499280.pdf) during the Six-Day War? Yes. That's a complicated little piece of information.

No matter how complicated various little tidbits of facts are -- facts that can be twisted and halfway-represented to form whatever narrative Zionists are spouting -- at its core, *this issue is one of a colonial power in the cruel, drawn-out process of stealing land from indigenous people.*

And that's not complex.

&#x200B;

* **Anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Jews need a safe state of their own to live in, and being against that idea is being against Jews.**

Many Jews are against the idea of an ethnostate being founded in their name. Some are religiously against it, such as [Neturei Karta](https://www.nkusa.org/). Some are secularly against it, in the name of humanitarian ethics that demand freedom and agency for every member of a country, rather than an apartheid ethnostate based on race. Some aren't against a Jewish ethnostate ever existing, but are completely against the state of Israel in particular due to the incalculably cruel histories of its founding as well as its current policies.

Look into [IfNotNow](https://www.ifnotnowmovement.org/) and [Jewish Voice for Peace](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/), which are two of the Jewish organizations that protest Zionism alongside Neturei Karta. Look up the observantly-Jewish voices of respected sociological and political thinkers like [Gabor Mate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHDBw-wx6w0), [Ilan Pappe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK7jckzam5c), [Noman Finkelstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZGPZRkqJzY), and [Noam Chomsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbWoWSRDCIk).

[Mondoweiss](https://mondoweiss.net/) is a site that posts pro-Palestine news and opinion pieces written mainly by Jews. [The Gray Zone](https://thegrayzone.com/) is a subversive website headed by Max Blumenthal, a Jew, that posts highly critical pieces on the Israeli occupation and uncovers a lot of what is hidden by the mainstream media. [Breaking the Silence](https://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/) is a database of ex-IDF soldiers who are coming out as whistleblowers against the cruel oppression that is part-and-parcel of Israeli military occupation.

Stop pretending that ""Jewish"" and ""Israeli"" are interchangeable words. Judaism is a beautiful Abrahamic faith, that like all other Abrahamic faiths, at its core teaches peace and love and kindness. Many followers of these faiths cherry-pick their religions in order to follow their whims. However, the religion itself is one of generosity and love and submission to God's will: and many Jews follow their religion, and do not appreciate Israeli oppression, apartheid, and genocide.

&#x200B;

* **The majority of pro-Palestinian activists don't know what they're talking about. They just repeat buzzwords like ""colonialism"" and ""apartheid"" because it's the cool thing to do. They're wannabe revolutionaries and they'll grow up and learn.**

This is not true. For one thing, those buzzwords carry meaning. Genocide is a real thing.

For another thing, demeaning an activity as ""the cool thing to do"" and scorning people as just jumping on bandwagons is a way to appeal to the [conservative brain](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72980-x#:~:text=Neuroimaging%20studies%20have%20shown%20that,while%20making%20risky%20decisions14) \-- and I know this, because I have a stubborn conservative brain myself. It takes active effort to learn new things and change my mind. As a teenager, I actually thought the Palestinians should just leave the land to Israel and stop fighting over it and share. I didn't like how Israel was killing people, but in my mind the answer was clear: just leave.

I'm not a wannabe revolutionary, and neither are the majority of people struggling for justice in this world. That's a ridiculous and childish attack on people's genuine well-researched convictions.

&#x200B;

* **Palestinians don't want peace; they refused peace agreements several times.**

Palestinians want peace so much that the PA has recognized the state of Israel, which is an invading colonial body that has historically displaced Palestinians from their land. Despite these efforts for peace, there has never actually been any genuine, fair peace offer. Israelis like to talk about the Oslo Accords but although they were the closest to fair, they never truly allowed for the existence of an independent Palestinian State. [Rabin himself, before he was assassinated, stated that there would be no Palestinian statehood.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rabin-formally-opposed-a-palestinian-state-more-than-a-year-after-white-house-handshake-letter-from-1994-shows/)

Zionists like to say that if Rabin had not been assassinated by an Israeli right-winger, Palestine would have peace. But even Rabin would not have allowed Palestine its own freedom and agency.

There are many genuine analyses of this falsehood, and here is one, with [Rashid Khalidi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb8HKNxUtnw).

&#x200B;

* **Hamas went on a rape, murder, and beheading spree on Oct 7, killing upwards of 1200 people.**

There has never been actual proof of Hamas killing that many people, or raping anybody. There has instead been a lot of evidence that the IDF killed the majority of their own people in crossfire and shelling from both military tanks and apache helicopters. [Max Blumenthal has covered this, and there are links throughout this summary as well as more information that can be researched independently.](https://thegrayzone.com/2023/10/27/israels-military-shelled-burning-tanks-helicopters/) All the evidence is out there, and [despite Israeli civilians begging](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-victims-families-urge-icc-investigate-oct-7-hamas-attacks-2023-10-31/) for the International Criminal Court to investigate what truly happened on October 7th, [as well as other countries, Israel refuses to allow the ICC jurisdiction within the country in order to investigate.](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/17/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-crimes-icc-referral/index.html)

&#x200B;

* **Hamas hides behind civilians. That's the only reason that Israel has to bomb so many Gazan civilians, they're totally not trying to cause a genocide.**

Israel has been unable to prove that the headquarters of Hamas were beneath al Shifa hospital as they claimed. Instead we have a [small assortment of random weapons](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3241705/israeli-military-shows-video-weapons-found-gazas-al-shifa-hospital) that could fit in a duffel bag or two and could've been easily planted, a video of what is obviously just [a calendar presented as a hostage-guarding schedule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTcEL1BQ2qc), and a picture of what is [obviously just an elevator shaft presented as a nefarious tunnel](https://www.newsweek.com/did-israel-find-tunnel-under-al-shifa-hospital-what-video-shows-1844583). We have a report from amnesty international stating that no evidence of Hamas using human shields has been found, and actually there are multiple cases of Israel using Palestinian civilians as human shields. [Here's the report by Amnesty International on Israel's human shielding war crimes.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mde151432002en.pdf)

&#x200B;

* **Instead of demanding a ceasefire, people should demand that Hamas surrender to Israel.**

A ceasefire means both sides stop fighting. Sure, Hamas might break it, but Israel might break it too. A ceasefire is actually an unjust temporary measure that freezes an oppressive status quo. It is just temporary and meant to give the civilians a break. Hamas [has asked](https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/4632336-release-hostages-needs-ceasefire-hamas-official-says) for a [short ceasefire](https://www.businessinsider.com/hamas-gaza-offer-50-hostages-5-day-ceasefire-israel-rejected-2023-11) multiple times in order to send the civilian hostages safely back to Israel's side of the wall.

Demanding that Hamas surrender is not only suggesting that any armed resistance to occupation and oppression must stop (regardless of Hamas' particular war crimes) but is tantamount to worsening conditions for all Palestinians, and accepting those worsened conditions as a new status quo.

That is not justice. A ceasefire is not justice either. But at least it will allow the millions of terrorized civilians in the region to have a break. A daily pause is not enough when churches, schools, hospitals, and refugee camps are being bombed -- when journalists are being targeted -- when over five thousand children have been slaughtered just since the beginning of this bombing campaign by Israel.

&#x200B;

* **Anyone supporting a free Palestine is actually supporting Hamas.**

Anyone supporting a free Palestine is actually supporting the removal of Hamas, because if Palestine was free then they would not need or desire any armed resistance to the occupation. For decades, Palestinians persisted in mostly peaceful means of negotiating and protesting apartheid. Israel constantly responded with death and brutality. The majority of pro-Palestine supporters do not support Hamas at all, and find their methods to be unconscionable -- but truthfully recognize Israeli oppression as the root of the conflict in the region.

&#x200B;

* **Gaza is already free, Israel withdrew settlements from the Gaza Strip, so why are they still shooting rockets? It's just because they hate Jews.**

Israel has [imposed a blockade](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/gaza-blockade-israel.html#:~:text=For%20some%20Gazans%2C%20Saturday%20morning's,large%2Dscale%20response%20from%20Israel) on the Gaza Strip for \~16 years. Not only that, but they continually snipe over the wall and kill [hundreds of people engaged in peaceful protest](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2020-03-06/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/42-knees-in-one-day-israeli-snipers-open-up-about-shooting-gaza-protesters/0000017f-f2da-d497-a1ff-f2dab2520000), they send in drones to [spray Gazan gardens with herbicide](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/israeli-spraying-of-herbicide-near-gaza-harming-palestinian-crops#:~:text=The%20study%20tracked%20the%20drift,metres%20(980ft)%20into%20Gaza), and they forcibly control [freshwater and electricity](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-keeps-blocking-power-water-food-to-gaza-interior-ministry/3037404) resources. The Gaza Strip is incredibly densely packed, full of refugees from all the land that Israel violently claimed in 1948, and they are living in unsustainable squalor and misery thanks to the blockade. Despite that they are incredibly persistent and have a spirit of resilience that has led them to continue, somehow, surviving and resisting all this time.

&#x200B;

* **Free Palestine from Hamas! Hamas is ISIS! Food, not rockets! Hamas steals all the humanitarian aid. Why didn't Hamas invest in infrastructure? It's only because of Hamas that the Palestinians are suffering!**

Look at the West Bank; there's no Hamas there, and Palestinians are still suffering. It's because of Israel that Palestinians are suffering and it's also because of Israel that Hamas exists in the first place. Netanyahu initially [funded Hamas](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/israel-helped-funnel-qatar-money-to-fund-hamas-netanyahu-palestinian-state-gaza-war-2456157-2023-11-01) and [propped them up against the Palestinian governing bodies](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) because his party decided that Israel would never be safe with a free separate Palestinian state next door, and thus [he had to jeopardize the PA's attempts](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4268794-the-symbiotic-relationship-between-netanyahu-and-hamas/) for a two-state solution by manipulatively boosting an internal Palestinian opposition to their secular and peaceful political influence.

Lastly, Hamas does invest in infrastructure too: one of my most memorable conversations in my life was with a Gazan about 10 years ago who told me that her family was trying to build a house, but it took some time, because they had to smuggle concrete powder through tunnels. [Those infamous tunnels were originally dug to smuggle resources into Gaza. They are literally the infrastructure that allowed Gaza to survive the blockade.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip_smuggling_tunnels)

Every single thing is made more difficult by the Israeli blockade, including infrastructure. Every couple years, there is a bombing campaign against Gaza Strip that destroys buildings and kills children. Every time, the Gazans struggle to rebuild. It's incredibly disingenuous to talk about infrastructure when you consider the context, and how much they actually struggle with infrastructure.

&#x200B;

* **Jewishness is a religion, but it's also a race. And that race is in peril because everyone hates them everywhere, and they need their own country to be safe.**

If you are considering a Jew on the basis of race alone, on the basis of semitic heritage, then many Arabs are also semites, yeah? [They are the descendants of Abrahamic Jews.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/)

It's understandable if an *ideology* such as a religion is somehow so unpalatable to everyone else that this ideology needs to have its own space. Nobody else would probably even want into that space, unless they shared this unpalatable ideology. But, if such a space was established for an ideology, it shouldn't be founded on top of other indigenous peoples with a different ideology who would need to be kicked out. As [Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived peacefully together in Palestine](https://www.972mag.com/before-zionism-the-shared-life-of-jews-and-palestinians/) before the foundation of Israel, a supposed ideological conflict between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism is provably not to an issue.

The issue that Zionists will have you believe is that everyone hates the \*race\* of Jews, not necessarily the religion. And this is not true either. It's ultimately very racist on every side to claim that a race needs its own space because it is so unpalatable to everyone else. No race of human beings needs its own country. Humankind needs to be less racist. That's it.

&#x200B;

* **Israel can't stop because then the terrorists will annihilate all the Jews. Palestinians want the death of all Jews. That's why they elected Hamas. It's in Hamas's charter to kill all the Jews!**

The ""election"" \~16 years ago in Gaza was almost a farce, and the majority of Gazans alive today did not even vote in it, either because they were unable due to age or difficulty at the polls, or because they had not even been born, or for the usual reason people don't vote: no faith in the process.

Hamas's charter is admittedly antisemitic but again, they would not exist without Israel. They have been taught an antisemitic agenda -- not by their own as Zionists would have you believe, but by Israel itself. Israel is the one who equates Judaism with Zionism and uses Zionism to suppress and oppress the Palestinian people.

Why is it any wonder that Hamas also equates Judaism with Zionism? This is actually what the Israelis want. An ad for birthright trips to Israel recently stated ""God doesn't care that you eat bacon. You're still a Jew."" [There are many of these ads that tout Jewishness as a race rather than an ideology, and equate Zionism to Judaism. (And thus antisemitism to anti-Zionism.)](https://jweekly.com/2022/06/06/who-is-paying-for-these-jewbelong-bacon-billboards-in-the-east-bay/)

These people consider Jewishness to be an ethnicity rather than a belief system. AND, they want Jews to be oppressed, all over the world, in order to force them to participate in Zionism in order to feel safe.

But it's important to understand that a Zionist is not even necessarily a Jew. A Jew is someone who follows Judaism. A Zionist is someone who believes in the racist state of Israel. Their God is not the One God, it is the false idol of nationalism. That is what Zionists truly worship and it is echoed in their actions, no matter what they say. And what Zionists don't want you to know is that even in the depths of Gaza, a Jew can be safe. See the next point...

&#x200B;

* **Oh, you're a woman protesting for Palestine? Go wear those clothes in Gaza and see what happens! Oh you're a anti-Zionist Jew? Try to go be a Jew in Gaza! Oh, you're LGBTQ+ and you support a free Palestine? Didn't you know that Hamas throws gay people off rooftops?! Israel is the only bastion of civility and decency in the entire Middle East!**

No matter what someone's religious beliefs may be, that doesn't mean they get to push those beliefs on someone else. Misled and uneducated people may commit crimes against others, and some of those people might be Muslims, but this entire argument just feeds into foolish western Islamophobia that serves to fuel western imperialism.

Because imperialism is one of the forces behind the establishment of Israel, it's understandable that they are pushing Islamophobia. However, Gaza actually is not just made of Muslims. Jews, Muslims, Christians, and secular people were peacefully living in Palestine all together, before the Balfour Declaration which established the state of Israel.

An ancient Greek Orthodox church, the oldest church in Gaza, St Porphyrius, was bombed during this most recent genocidal campaign in 2023. [Built in 1150 AD](https://www.archpaper.com/2023/10/saint-porphyrius-church-built-in-1150-is-destroyed-by-an-israeli-strike-during-ongoing-conflict/), it was believed to be the third oldest church in the world and was kept safe and maintained even through Hamas' rule. Israel is the one who destroyed it. Do Christian women wear hijab? Maybe sometimes.

But even many Muslims do not wear hijab. Look at the well-known female journalists who are documenting the bombardment on the ground right now. Does [Bisan](https://www.tiktok.com/@savechildrenuk/video/7300994812881177888) wear a hijab? No. The argument that women are oppressed in Gaza is patently incorrect.

As for LGBTQ+, I'm not denying that queer people are suppressed across the middle east. What Israelis don't tell you is that it's not as if Israel is so different in this regard. [Gay marriage is illegal in Israe](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2015-06-30/ty-article/.premium/gay-marriage-unlikely-in-israel/0000017f-ef9d-dc28-a17f-ffbf0b740000)l too. And even if gays are being thrown off roofs by Hamas, why would you support the side that has de-facto created Hamas, and is actively bombing and killing those same queer people? [My heart is broken for these people's stories](https://time.com/6326254/queering-the-map-gaza-lgbt-palestinians/) in the same way it would be broken for the suffering of innocent Christians.

As a Muslim and self-professed fundamentalist (meaning I genuinely have faith in the fundamentals of my Abrahamic faith), I believe hate crimes are wrong, no matter who is targeted. And LGBTQ+ people are among some of the kindest and thoughtful humans I have known. As individuals, the vast majority of them are not so cruel, dumb, and selfish as to demand the slaughter and genocide of an entire people in order to strike some supposed blow for liberalism.

As for Jews, why would a Jew chose to live in Gaza, which is an open air prison, rather than Israel, where they are given top status on the social hierarchy according to race? The answer is that this Jew is a journalist with integrity who wants to see what things are really like on the ground. Dan Cohen, along with Max Blumenthal, has lived in Gaza for several months in a row.  [Here's an interview with Dan Cohen on what it was like to live in Gaza as a Jew.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUxWw0dMkNs)

&#x200B;

* **Doesn't Hamas realize they're harming their own people when they start these fights with Israel?**

Hamas did not *start* the fight. They simply subscribe to the mentality that death is better than oppression. When you oppress a people, you might hope to break them. But Palestinians aren't easily broken. If you consider the Gazans as one body, Hamas is their ugly callus, formed by constant difficult friction with the oppressors. If that friction stops, the callus heals.

The idea that oppressed people should be frightened into silence is an idiotic, weak-minded mentality that feeds into the goals of the oppressor.

&#x200B;

* **Why don't the neighboring Arab countries take in the Palestinians? Palestinians already have a state, it's called Jordan! Look, not even Egypt wants these savage animals.**

This is just a transparent ploy to force the Palestinians off the land that they have tended and inhabited for centuries, in order to ethnically cleanse an ethno-state for Zionists. It was coincidentally also a Nazi argument for attempting to exterminate Jews in Germany, based on the fact that the rest of the [Western countries didn't want to accept a mass exodus of Jewish refugees](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/27/14412082/refugees-history-holocaust).

It is a genocidal argument, made for literally ethnically cleansing the region, in order to make Israel a majority-Jewish-race country. Have the people making this argument considered that maybe the Palestinians don't want to be refugees? They don't want to be kicked off their ancestral homeland that they are indigenous to?

&#x200B;

* **Well, if the bombardment is the wrong tactic, then tell me! What should Israel do? What can they do when people are trying to kill them!? Doesn't Israel have the right to defend itself?**

Ner Kitri is a Jewish Israeli who published an article about the [One Democratic State](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/07/the-transition-from-a-jewish-state-to-true-democracy-will-benefit-all/) solution. Look at history for the answer. What did South Africa do to solve its apartheid problem? [The framing of the post-apartheid South African constitution is a good example for Israel to follow.](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/Framing%20the%20State/Chapter5_Framing.pdf)

Fair integration of all people is the only decent and just choice for Israel to do. Fears that this will result in the eradication of Jews is phobic, racist propaganda that dehumanizes and vilifies people who are resisting injustice and apartheid. White people were not eradicated in South Africa, even though the ANC was classed as a terrorist organization and Nelson Mandela was in prison for ""terrorism"". Nobody will be eradicated in Israel if Israel stops being an apartheid state.

That is purely a fearmongering excuse for people who do not actually want to integrate fairly.

17vp9kj,Important regional context for newbies: the Proxy Wars,"What a lot of folk new to this historical conflict miss in context is the proxy war being fought between the two major players in this arena, Saudi Arabia and Iran, since 1979.

You have mostly Shiite militant groups (Hamas being Sunni) being backed by the Iranian regime, Qatar, AKP Turkey, fighting in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon etc. against factions funded or supported by their opposition (Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, the other Gulf states).  It must be noted that there were also shifts of allegiance between groups. [In 2014 the latter Arab leaders also made no secret of their support of Israel.](https://www.cnn.com/2014/07/31/world/meast/israel-gaza-region/index.html) Even Sudan was involved.

18bjztu,What are there antisemites attached to the leaders of the pro-Isreal movement?,"This is a trend I've noticed since the start of the current conflict, though it definitely has been going on long before, that both concerns me and represents hypocrisy with some on the pro-Israel side. I've noticed some prominent antisemites (particularly in the U.S.) will show absolute support for Israel, and even work with Israeli government officials, yet will not be denounced by pro-Israel activists and leaders, or even acknowledge these people and their bigotry. Even if they do, it's still odd to me that these antisemites get drawn to the pro-Israel movement in the first place, or hear Zionists themselves make these talking points.

The most egregious example has to be Christian hate preacher John Hagee, who literally blamed Jews for the Holocaust, believes they secretly control the U.S. economy, and claimed Hitler was ""sent by God"" to create Israel. He spoke at the recent  March for Israel rally ([https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://newrepublic.com/post/176924/far-right-pastor-john-hagee-democrats-share-stage-march-israel&ved=2ahUKEwj9lYT2pveCAxXFmGoFHdUMBoQQxfQBKAB6BAgJEAI&usg=AOvVaw2H7b5Ts8-OpeP33EkTDRXn](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://newrepublic.com/post/176924/far-right-pastor-john-hagee-democrats-share-stage-march-israel&ved=2ahUKEwj9lYT2pveCAxXFmGoFHdUMBoQQxfQBKAB6BAgJEAI&usg=AOvVaw2H7b5Ts8-OpeP33EkTDRXn)) in D.C. and was widely cheered by the crowd. You know, the one attended by nearly 300,000 thousand people. Hagee is also close with Israeli leaders like \[Netanyahu\]([https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.haaretz.com/2012-03-19/ty-article/waiting-for-the-messiah-netanyahu-addresses-evangelical-christian-gathering-in-jerusalem/0000017f-dc91-d856-a37f-fdd125b80000&ved=2ahUKEwir1-3DpveCAxXtj2oFHezMDYgQFnoECBoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw291Nwlrf\_qm0UpGyb4VKEa](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.haaretz.com/2012-03-19/ty-article/waiting-for-the-messiah-netanyahu-addresses-evangelical-christian-gathering-in-jerusalem/0000017f-dc91-d856-a37f-fdd125b80000&ved=2ahUKEwir1-3DpveCAxXtj2oFHezMDYgQFnoECBoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw291Nwlrf_qm0UpGyb4VKEa)). He is part of the Christian Zionist movement, who believe Jews returning to Israel will trigger the Rapture ([https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/gaza-war-evangelical-leaders-cheer-end-world-1234884151/amp/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/gaza-war-evangelical-leaders-cheer-end-world-1234884151/amp/)), which will end with the Jews either converting to Christianity or being killed. I'm an atheist, so I obviously don't believe this will happen, but he does not sound like he wants to help Israel for humanitarian reasons. His comments on Jewish people were so abhorrent, racist, Warhawk Republican John McCain had to refuse Hagee's endorsement for his presidential campaign in 2008. I only saw pro-Palestinians/anti-Zionists condemn his speech at the pro-Israel march, not anyone at the pro-Israel camp.

Some of the most blatant antisemitism I've seen (at least in the U.S.) has come from far-right politicians, some of the most hawkish supporters of the Israeli government.

The ADL has condemned some of her comments, yet pro-Israel politicians are silent on her hypocrisy.

Donald Trump, who possibly supported Israel more than any president in U.S. history, has a history of antisemitism himself, yet remained an ally of Netanyahu. Trump had dinner last year with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes as West was diving all-in on antisemitism and neo-Nazi talking points. He also refuses to scare off his base of neo-Nazi supporters ([https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/07/electoral-logic-behind-trumps-antisemitism-00072661](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/07/electoral-logic-behind-trumps-antisemitism-00072661)), and famously defended white supremacist protestors in Charlottesville who chanted ""Jews will not replace us,"" claiming that there ""good people on both sides."" Recently, he criticized ""liberal Jews"" for not voting for him in 2020, but I will give credit to the ADL for denouncing his comments.

What I can't defend is ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt defending Elon Musk. I don't think I need to recap the world's (supposedly) richest man who went insanely viral recently for explicitly endorsing the Great Replacement theory ([https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musk-curses-out-advertisers-who-left-x-over-antisemitic-content-2023-11-29/&ved=2ahUKEwjT\_eG5wPeCAxWVk2oFHUyyDn8QFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3l6YHUhhrbSNsC1OuXvg7N](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musk-curses-out-advertisers-who-left-x-over-antisemitic-content-2023-11-29/&ved=2ahUKEwjT_eG5wPeCAxWVk2oFHUyyDn8QFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3l6YHUhhrbSNsC1OuXvg7N)) on his social media platform Twitter (I'm not calling it X). While Greenblatt initially condemned the tweet, he then praised Musk literally the next day for ""combating hate""([https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/anti-defamation-league-elon-musk-jonathan-greenblatt-antisemitism-critics-interviews-1234897065/amp/&ved=2ahUKEwi9oIzawPeCAxUnTTABHfcHDvIQFnoECA8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2oXmOGn2cnwEBQn5ut0vjP](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/anti-defamation-league-elon-musk-jonathan-greenblatt-antisemitism-critics-interviews-1234897065/amp/&ved=2ahUKEwi9oIzawPeCAxUnTTABHfcHDvIQFnoECA8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2oXmOGn2cnwEBQn5ut0vjP)) after Musk simply said he would suppress PRO-PALESTINIAN content and not the dangerous conspiracy. This came after the organization rightfully pointed out for months that neo-Nazi content has rapidly increased since he took over Twitter. Oh, and Musk went on an apology tour to Israel the next week and smoozed with Netanyahu ([https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/world/elon-musk-visits-israel-to-meet-top-leaders-as-accusations-of-antisemitism-on-x-grow&ved=2ahUKEwi-iPb5wveCAxVrlWoFHXkJCsY4ChAWegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw3eb2ZCtuflIznO86XtYzwP](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/world/elon-musk-visits-israel-to-meet-top-leaders-as-accusations-of-antisemitism-on-x-grow&ved=2ahUKEwi-iPb5wveCAxVrlWoFHXkJCsY4ChAWegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw3eb2ZCtuflIznO86XtYzwP)) to declare strong support for Israel. Apparently, all you need to do to be absolved of antisemitism to Zionist leaders is to be anti-Palestinian and pro-Israel.

Speaking of Netanyahu, why don't we talk about his son, Nair, who in 2017 posted a highly antisemitic cartoon of George Soros ([https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/13/netanyahu-son-yair-antisemitic-cartoon-george-soros](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/13/netanyahu-son-yair-antisemitic-cartoon-george-soros)) in 2017 that got the endorsement of the KKK's David Duke himself ([https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2017-09-10/ty-article/when-david-duke-agrees-with-the-israeli-prime-ministers-son/0000017f-db24-db5a-a57f-db6edfc60000](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2017-09-10/ty-article/when-david-duke-agrees-with-the-israeli-prime-ministers-son/0000017f-db24-db5a-a57f-db6edfc60000)). While Yair did receive criticism in Israel, I find it odd that the son of the Israeli prime minister, the self-proclaimed Jewish state, would so blatantly express antisemitic and facist talking points.

Then there's Charlie Kirk and Tucker Carlson, two of the most prominent right-wing talking heads out there. They have been peddling the Great Replacement theory to their white supremacist audiences for years, and ramped up this rhetoric after Oct. 7 ([https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/musk-carlson-kirk-antisemitism-israel-palestine-gaza-great-replacement\_n\_6557be0fe4b05723e4bd2e5a/amp&ved=2ahUKEwiAqLO7w\_eCAxXikGoFHRDWCDEQFnoECBIQAQ&usg=AOvVaw26X6uFBednEUUoNVmpSPVW](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/musk-carlson-kirk-antisemitism-israel-palestine-gaza-great-replacement_n_6557be0fe4b05723e4bd2e5a/amp&ved=2ahUKEwiAqLO7w_eCAxXikGoFHRDWCDEQFnoECBIQAQ&usg=AOvVaw26X6uFBednEUUoNVmpSPVW)). Unlike the overwhelming majority of pro-Palestinian protestors, these are actual antisemites who hate Jewish people, and that's why they haven't been fawning over Israel lately. They want to see both Jews and Muslims dead, but pro-Israel activists seem silent on these actual explicit antisemites while focusing on pro-Palestinian protestors. I guess I am curious why that is.

There are other examples I'm missing, but these are the big ones I can think of. I'm not daft enough to think these people are connected or represent every Zionist/pro-Israel activist in the movement, and I strongly condemn any antisemitism that pops up in the pro-Palestinian or Zionist movements. I just find it very odd and hypocritical when some Zionists will ignore these people, even if they are involved with pro-Israel movements, and point out a handful of extremists that do not represent the overwhelming majority of the pro-Palestinian movement. I would hope Zionists and pro-Israel would want to denounce and distance themselves from anyone who spouts antisemitic rhetoric, even if they claim to be on the side of Israel.",05/12/23 19:26:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18bjztu/what_are_there_antisemites_attached_to_the/,3,41,934,Oct 7,top,all
1alea6d,Pro Israel Rehotroric in Media,"There was a recent post on this sub-reddit which how israel has been unduly targeted by the media. In my opinion it's hard for me to understand how one can have that opinion as the media is mostly completely pro Israel ( Let's not count aljazerra or mayadeen as established news outlets ) and upholds journalistic bad practice to make Israel looks like the good side . I will post bellow with links and sources of multiple times giant media/social media/government that displayed israel bias not reporting the story as is. I will go small and large stories to not nitpick to try and prove the media is pro Israel.

1.
https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/12/20/meta-systemic-censorship-palestine-content

""Systemic Censorship of Palestine Content on Instagram and Facebook,” documents a pattern of undue removal and suppression of protected speech including peaceful expression in support of Palestine and public debate about Palestinian human rights.""

Meta including Facebook and Instagram algorithmicly took down palestinian contents for simple expressing pro palestinian rhetoric.  To be clear here this wasn't hamas posts these were content such as ceasefire now or long live palestinian posts. It basically classified solidarity with Palestinians civilians as hate speech.

2. 
https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/unrwa-hamas-gaza-canada-1.7107785

""The government of Canada did not see any evidence backing up Israel's claim that staff employed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) colluded with Hamas"" ""  Channel Four reported that the dossier was only six pages long. The news service said it rehashes long-standing Israeli government complaints about UNRWA and alleges the involvement of UNRWA staff in the Oct 7 attack, but ""provides no evidence"" to back up Israel's explosive allegations against the agency.""

Let's be clear here the U.S , Canada and multiple countries stopped funding to the UNRWA without any single viable evidence. This story after Israel sent the dossier to new organizations such as NY Times , Washington post and BBC were are reported without any clarification that this was being provided by the government without evidence. This is journalistic malpractice at the highest point. If hamas were to send documents to new organizations with no evidence and they published it , israel would be in an uproar.

3.

https://theintercept.com/2024/01/28/new-york-times-daily-podcast-camera/

""THE NEW YORK Times pulled a high-profile episode of its podcast “The Daily” about sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas on October 7 amid a furious internal debate about the strength of the paper’s original reporting on the subject""

The daily might be the best news podcast in America and had to shelf an episode with the main gest that the main author that wrote about sexual violence by hamas on Oct 7 that they did happen. Wanted to write a follow up saying some of his sources appear to be untrustworthy and the new york times basically denied the article not liking the image. The new york times have three authors that have children currently serving in the idf writings about this conflict. Something that journalistic standard is not appropriate considering this daily news a cause of concern.

""Dearborn, Michigan, is ramping up its police presence in response to fallout from an opinion piece that described the city, which has the nation’s highest Muslim population per capita, as “America’s jihad capital.”

A simple story the Washington post wrote an opinion peace on Dearborn Michigan calling it America Jihad capital simply because the population is largely Muslim and palestinian. To note there has not been any terrorism originating from Dearborn and this overall comes across as an Islamophobic attack by one of the largest newspaper in the United states

4. I'm going to lump a few in this one as this post can honestly go for much longer

https://www.thenational.scot/news/24036832.sky-news-condemned-report-killed-palestinian-child/

""They found a “systematic disparity in how Palestinian and Israeli deaths are treated” by the BBC, with words such as murder, massacre, and slaughter almost exclusively being linked to Israeli deaths""

People on this sub-reddit love to hate on the BBC saying there anti Semitic and not trusting. When study goes on how they use terminology it goes in israel favor.

https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/palestinian-women-youths-be-swapped-israeli-hostages-2023-11-22/

This was one that happened during the hostage swaps. Almost collectively news were reporting the palestinian prisoners are youth and women while using the Israeli hamas as children and girls.

This list goes on and on. I don't think people can say the media is not on israel side in good faith.  There is no doubt the collective people are pro palestinian but in terms of organizations, news outlets and governments as a collective there are biased to  an Israeli point of view.

\- No strawmen or false arguments

  
I shall list the problems in no particular order of importance. 

  
**1. Lack of objective, authoritative mediation.**

This conflict has been exacerbated by the utter lack of an effective referee. The United States has been a poor defender of Israeli interests because it has failed to rein in Israeli excesses when doing so would clearly have served Israel's greater good. She has also failed in successive attempts to broker deals with the Palestinians because the Palestinians just don't trust the US, and with good, obvious reason! US partisanship has been an anvil around the possibilities of peace because the US - the world's biggest superpower - is essentially seen as an extension of Israeli foreign policy. When it comes to US foreign policy, where the middle east in general, and Israel in particular are concerned, Israel is the tail that wags the American dog. Until the United States reasserts itself as the independent superpower it's supposed to be, it is essentially useless to the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine.

  
**2. Failure to recognise obvious power imbalance** 

It is an inescapable fact that Israel is easily the (much!) more powerful opponent in this conflict. It is not, and has never been close. That power imbalance is most obviously manifest and relevant in Israel's military capacity that is brought to bear in the occupied territories. This matters because any honest reckoning of the issues must acknowledge that this is not a fight between equal forces, which is partly why there is always vast disproportion between casualties, anytime there is a skirmish. This is not even David v Goliath. This is more like child David v an entire city of grown Goliaths. The mismatch is so stark that there really is no contest here. Certainly not a military, or economic one anyway. And that means nobody can pretend they don't know which side is causing more injury, death and destruction to the other. Israel has been beating a much weaker opponent to a pulp for decades.

  
**3. The Occupation, and International Law** 

It is an inescapable fact that Israel are illegal occupiers of Palestinian territory. And this occupation is inhumane, unrelenting, and brutal. Israel maintains that occupation is necessary to protect Israelis. This decades-long occupation is the single most obvious reason for Palestinian hate towards the State of Israel. It is Apartheid. Israel is a signatory to the UN charter. As such, she subscribes to the validity of International laws, one of which, UN resolution 37/43, asserts (amongst several clauses) thus; *""Reaffirms the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for their independence, territorial integrity, national unity and liberation from colonial domination, apartheid and foreign occupation by all available means, including armed struggle""*. Put simply, the Palestinians have a legal right to resist occupation of their country by physical/military means.

  
And Israel has a right to defend herself. It is not productive to ask whether Israel has a right to exist - she does, and she is a fact that is going nowhere. 

  
**4. Poor leadership**

Palestinians have repeatedly failed to match the righteousness of their cause, with strong effective leadership. Not since Yasser Arafat (who was not perfect by any stretch) have the Palestinians been unified and led by a single competent leadership structure. Between Fattah and Hamas, ordinary Palestinians are laboured with a fractured resistance movement. And it doesn't help that some of the resistance movement leaders are rumoured to live lives of opulence and great private wealth. 

For their part, Israel struggles with honest leadership too. Netanyahu is the poster child for Israeli corruption, and he is currently fighting indictments on multiple counts of corruption. Anyone who thinks his personal criminal issues have no influence on this war, is criminally naive. This war has suspended all talk of his prosecution. There alone is the influence. It is clear, therefore, that an early cessation of this war is not good for Netanyahu. But nobody will say that out loud, lest they be accused of grievous antisemitism. And so he populated his war cabinet with virulently right wing hawks so he could enjoy the cover of consensus, and claim leadership of a unified front. The world bought it, but the thin veneer of reasonableness cracked recently when Heritage Minister Amihay Eliyahu suggested nuking Gaza! His punishment for such incendiary talk? Suspension. Israel badly needs serious leadership. Aside from his legal misdemeanors, Netanyahu comes from the school of thought that says Israel needs a perpetual enemy in order to survive. This paints Palestinians in the unenviable position of having to assure Israel's future, by being their requisite enemy. 

  
**5. Arab apathy** 

The countries of the middle east have been content to pay lip service to the struggles of their Palestinian brethren. As a bloc of incredibly wealthy, globally influential countries, they could do much more to offer Palestinians the kind of support that Israel enjoys from the US. In fact if they wanted to, they could provide effective counter balancing to the US' weighty backing of Israel. But Arab unity around the Palestinian issue has simply not been effective.  


**6. Israel's right to exist** 

For as long as Hamas, who officially govern Gaza, continues to deny Israel's right to exist, Israelis who need or want war, will be assured of it. This is the Israeli excuse that keeps on giving. This mortal ""threat"" was given teeth on October 7, 2023. In truth, everybody knows that Hamas don't have anywhere near the muscle to deny Israel's existence. 

  
**7. Killing of civilians**

For all their insistence that they do not target civilians, Israel has proven to be exceptionally poor at avoiding their deaths. This tells the truth of their intent. Words can never make a point as authentically as actions. And if we should be judged by our actions and their results, then so should Israel, and Hamas. Some will argue that on Oct 7, Hamas did what they could to prosecute their resistance. But their actions were morally, and strategically bereft of logic, not to mention utterly inhumane. Aside from being entirely barbaric, they gave Israel the perfect strategic reason to unleash predictable unbridled fury. Over 10,000 dead Palestinian civilians later, and it's clear that Israel's killing is only just getting started. And so Israelis and Palestinians must reconcile a number of uncomfortable facts:

* By any reasonable definition, Israel is prosecuting a genocide on Palestinians. There is simply no way to deny this fact. 
* It is also an undeniable fact that no country could ever tolerate an attack of the likes of October 7th. 
* October 7th did not happen in a vacuum, and no people could ever tolerate the unbearable conditions that Palestinians exist under. 

  
**8. Rape of Palestinian resources**

Israel is exploiting oil and gas reserves that don't belong to them. 

  
**9. Jerusalem**

Neither Israelis nor Palestinians want to give Jerusalem up. The simple fact of this issue is neither party can have all it wants. 

  
**10. Iran**

Their influence over events in the middle east has been undeniable, and too frequently negative, at least in terms of western perceptions. But if viewed at face value, the Iranians should have far less to get busy about if Palestinians win their freedom. 

  
Now an attempt at solutions in principle, again in no particular order. 

  
**1. New, effective mediation**

This conflict requires fresh mediation from a new party who command respect, have a keen understanding of the issues, and are as welcome in Tel Aviv and Washington, as they are in the West Bank or Riyadh, or Doha. But it clearly cannot be the Americans any longer, and they should welcome this with relief so that they can be free to drop any pretense of objectivity, and demonstrate their backing of Israel with free abandon. Perhaps the Norwegians, Rwandans could be persuaded to step into the breach as a joint effort.

  
**2. New, effective leadership** 

Whether one considers the two-state solution often touted by the US, or a one-state solution vehemently rejected by Israel, the obvious truth is that Israel clearly has no current interest in engaging in any sort of peace. They may say they do, but their actions over recent decades prove otherwise. Israel must show their intent in ways that only they, as the much more powerful partner, can.  
For starters, the Israeli people must elect strong new (young!) leaders whose desire for peace is stronger than their thirst for blood, and is not seen as a weakness. They need new leaders who understand that peace requires serious, painful compromise, and understand that there is no alternative to peace. Fundamentally, they need to show that they are willing to negotiate in good faith as equal partners. Early demonstrations of intent might include recognition of the need for a single contiguous Palestinian state, relaxation of their vice grip on Gaza and West Bank, as well as releasing Palestinians detained without charge, and prosecuting people found guilty of military excesses, including the murder of journalists such as Shireen Abu Akleh. Israel must do what she would, if Shireen had been Israeli. Another important measure could be offering the principle of sharing Jerusalem.   
For their part, the Palestinians must show they are serious about tending to Israeli security concerns by renouncing Hamas and reaffirming recognition of Israel. Hamas is over. October 7 killed any chance of Hamas ever again being useful participants to the cause of Palestinian freedom. The best Hamas can hope for now is consideration for a quick and safe return of all hostages.   
This of course doesn't mean the Palestinians must renounce the armed resistance to occupation that is their right. It simply means Hamas as a resistance movement must end their current form, and perhaps rebrand and re-emerge with a new, more productive charter that aligns with more progressive aspirations. Again, this doesn't mean giving up an inch of ground in terms of negotiated demands. It just means restoring Palestinians' potential for a representative seat at their own negotiating table. To this end, Palestinians must establish serious structures of representative government that allow citizens (especially women - this is critical!) to voice and distill ideas, whilst polishing ideators. They need new young ambitious leaders with fresh ideas rooted in a new vision that is not tethered to historically untenable objectives. And they need these young men and women to lead the institutions that will be the bedrock of new Palestinian governance defined only by them, and not dictated by anyone else. Palestinians badly need new, young leaders, and the more women amongst them the better. Why not even a woman as head of state? The message this would send would be inestimably powerful. 

  
**3. Security and Capital** 

Palestine needs a reconstruction fund to the tune of at least $2 to 3 trillion which must come from Arab resources. And that fund must be the basis for underwriting a new Palestinian state. It needs to be overwhelmingly massive for a reason - commitment. And there's no question that the Arabs can afford it. That fund would also pay for securing Palestinian nationhood both physically (perhaps a multinational Arab force) and in terms of capital for reconstruction, and for Palestine to fully exploit her considerable oil and gas potential. In order to be a viable state that is more focused on her own growth than the destruction of Israel, Palestinians need a vibrant self-sustaining economy that is able to educate, treat, produce goods, feed, employ, and defend itself in order to freely trade with the world, and with Israel.  This might require inviting both Palestine and Israel into regional bodies such as the GCC, or new ones built for cooperative purpose. This might also require that Palestine outsource military sovereignty to the Arab force for a predefined period. There are 26 countries that don't have their own army. Palestine could be the 27th, if cast iron assurances and measures are enabled to ensure effective physical deterrence, and strategic defence. No sovereign state can exist without a viable economy, and effective defence. The Palestinians will rightly insist on these. Also, such a fund would effectively sideline Iran as a negative influencer, and perhaps even persuade them into a more cooperative posture if they recognise Palestine's potential as a trading partner.    
So Israel doesn't feel threatened by the prospect of an economic powerhouse next door, the US could underwrite IMF loans to Israel to stimulate their economy. But as long as the US keep subsidising Israel, so then should Palestians enjoy access to equivalent credit lines to boost entrepreneurship and private enterprise, and support state macro-economic efforts like agriculture, IT, airports, marine services, oil and gas, professional and vocational training, infrastructure roll-out (water, electricity, transport, healthcare, communications, etc)   
Palestine and Israel must agree a joint defence pact that enshrines within it seriously handcuffed commitments to jointly invest in the anti terrorism and defence efforts. A strong, productive, viable Palestine is good for Israel. 

  
**4. Truth and reconciliation**

There must be a reckoning of the sins committed by both sides, on each other. Until those sins are confronted in their naked horror, no forgiveness is possible, and these two peoples will never coexist. That effort must be managed and executed by a neutral third party with experience but no direct skin in the game. They cannot be Arab or American, but both Palestinians and Israelis must sponsor this effort. This will be excruciating. But the more it is, the more durable the bond that will result afterwards. There is no getting around this. 

  
**5. Land return, and right of return of Palestinian refugees.**

Israel must return all occupied lands, and remove all surveillance apparatus from those spaces. No ifs or buts. In return, Palestine must relinquish the right of return of refugees to current Israeli lands. Additionally, Palestine must have full and unfettered authority over her own borders, including marine, air and land. That also means she must have sovereign authority over the natural resources contained within those borders.   
**6. Jerusalem.**

Palestine and Israel must share it. There is just no way around this. 

  
**7. Press freedom**

Israelis and Palestinians must agree to a charter than guarantees unfettered access of the free press. They must submit themselves to scrutiny in order to be kept honest. Israel's record with press freedom is appalling for a country that claims to be a democracy, and Palestinians have been too busy trying to survive to worry about creating frameworks for press freedom. But they need to have them. This is critical to keeping them honest, and to both protagonists playing by the same rules and treating each other as equals. 

  
Israel and Palestine are destined to be neighbors whether they like it or not. The only question is, how long will it take the Israelis to realise that they hold the key to peace because they have the power to wield either for peace, or for war. Every Palestinian orphan who wakes up in hospital, is a potential freedom fighter just waiting to be recruited. Israelis must grow up and disabuse themselves of notions that if only Hamas is eradicated, peace will magically become possible. Hamas are a freedom fighting idea with murderous kinetic agency. That idea will cease to exist the day Palestinians are granted their freedom. Until then, that idea will simply never die, because in the history of mankind, no people have ever tolerated occupation in perpetuity. The human being will give everything to be free. 

  
Obviously, the solutions proposed are massively simplified because the devil has always been in the minute details of this conflict. For example, it's all very well suggesting Israel and Palestine share Jerusalem, but the logistics of this, and policing any sharing agreement in practice (boots on ground) will require a level of intellectual brilliance and fortitude that has in fact never been seen before.   
Making peace will be like asking ten thousand people to simultaneously thread ten thousand needles that they're approaching at 100km/hour, riding pillion on bikes that have uneven tires, all moving on gravel surfaces.. and demanding they be thread at precisely the same instant. And it can be done!

Well worth reading. Along with a number of the comments. One sees the very different perspectives. The Palestinian focus on 1948 and 1967. The transition from Arab-Israeli to Palestinian-Israeli framing about 1967.  Keep in mind the background factors. The rise of Islamist ideology in the Middle East, and the takeover by Hamas in 2005 when Israel withdrew from Gaza. The ascension of the Israeli right with claims on disputed lands (Kontorovich). And especially Inbar’s caution that a Palestinian state would just be the next stage in the conflict. So in the end the conflict remains existential, and Oct 7 has driven home the point even to many outside of Israel.  Sometimes out of darkness new pathways emerge. Some have proposed a Federation. Such a construct would give Palestinians more legal autonomy. Why not consider that, even in a smaller negotiated footprint (largely Oslo Areas A&B), with defined rules on who has control of building rights under civil, not military law?    https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/20/magazine/israel-gaza-oslo-accords.html#commentsContainer",24/11/23 17:09:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/182wu1l/ny_times_article_nov_20_2023/,2,2,168,Oct 7,top,all
17wtx91,Context is the Achilles heel of the Israel hater.,"Israel has had a blockade on Gaza now for two decades and controls everything that goee in and out. The people of Gaza live in poverty. 
Context: Egypt also has a blockade on Gaza and both countries put the blockade in place after a terror group that wants to genocide all Jews was elected in Gaza. We saw a small hint of what would happen if Israel totally lifted the blockade on Oct 7.
Israel, the EU, America and other countries have provided billions in aid to Gaza. They've built water pipes for Gazans civilians which Hamas quickly dug up and used to build rockets. 

Palestinian land has largely shrunk over 75 years. 
Context: Israel occupied these lands after their Arab neighbours tried to destroy Israel. There was no ""Palestinian land"" before 1948 because there was no independent state of Palestine. Palestine as a national identity didn't even become widespread until 1964. 

A lot more Palestinians die compared to Israelis. 
Context: This is because Israel puts effort into protecting their citizens. After Oct 7, they completely evacuated the area surrounding Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to leave because it was too dangerous. Hamas on the other hand actually tell gazans to stay when Israel warn that they're going to bomb and block their exits. Israel also build bomb shelters for their citizens while Hamas build underground facilities only for Hamas. They've even said that the citizens of Gaza are Israel and the UN's responsibility. Israel also has the Iron Dome, one of the most sophisticated anti air defence systems in the world.

Palestinians in the west bank in the Israeli controlled areas aren't allowed to use the same roads as Israelis.
Context: Israel deals with hundreds of attempted terror attacks a year from the west bank. It makes complete sense that they would have strict borders and wouldn't just allow citizens of an unfriendly neighboring country with a sizeable terror problem including some from Hamas to just freely use the same roads as Israeli citizens.",16/11/23 18:31:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17wtx91/context_is_the_achilles_heel_of_the_israel_hater/,1,8,338,Oct 7,top,all
18cc8zw,Question about the West Bank,"Hi everyone,

I am not sure if this subreddit is appropriate to ask these questions below, so if it’s not appropriate then it’s okay to remove. I am genuinely curious for the questions I have on the West Bank. I’m not here to provoke or start a fight. Just as many people from around the world, I have been researching on the history of the entire conflict, and not just Oct 7. To the best of my ability, I have researched the perspectives of both Palestine and Israel. So, naturally during my research, I have a few questions about the West Bank. I live in Canada, so my research may be based on bias research (Not me, but sources available to me)

&#x200B;

Questions of the West Bank. 1) Is there restrictions as to where foreigners can go in the West Bank today? I am not sure if rules have changed since October 7.  2) As a Canadian, if I were to witness a settler(s) assault a Palestinian individual(s),  and I were to step in to protect the Palestinian(s) individual(s), **would I be attacked?** Even if I were to wave my Canadian passport, would I still be a target? 3) What are they best ways to avoid settlers following me or having suspicion of me? 

&#x200B;

I ask these questions because I’m very much curious. Sometimes, I can ask question that seems controversial and that’s only cause I seek the full information, for as to how situations are shaped up based on the past. I have not travelled to this part of the world before and I am continuing my research to be informed. Thank you, and I look forward to reading answers.

17rjb1b,Free Palestine from who/what?,"First time I heard free palestine after Oct 7th, I though the protesters meant free palestine from Hamas because who the hell wants to be governed by corrupt, fundamentalist, suicidal and genocidal nihilistic murderers.

Now after looking through the protests I'm struggling to understand what Free Palestine means.

Before the Oct 7 attack, there are from what I understand two Palestinian factions, the Gazan's under Hamas and the Palestinians in West Bank under PA/Fatah.

So when you hear free palestine from river to sea, does that mean uniting West Bank and Gaza under a two party system?  


If that was the goal why did Hamas destroy the opposition in Gaza in 2005 (threw them off buildings and shit) also Gazan's aren't allowed in West Bank and vice versa and there have been no elections in Gaza or West Bank since 2005.

So when Palestine is finally free, what does it look like exactly, who will be governing this free palestine?  


And what becomes of Israel which is in the middle of this?  


Considering the mess that Gaza is, can Gazan's govern themselves in a united palestine from river to sea.  


And by having 2 palestinian regions aren't they already kinda free?  
Israels condition to drop the blockade in Gaza and rollback settlements in West Bank was that the governments would recognise Israel and stop demanding its destruction which PA agreed to and Hamas didn't.  


So is West Bank Palestine more free than Gaza Palestine and why doesn't Hamas take PA's example and get their freedom instead of what they did on Oct 7 which basically condemned all of Gaza?  


Is there any logic in Hamas's approach, I don't understand it..

I'm trying to understand by speaking with friends who are pro palestine and want me to join the protest but when I raise these concerns they just stop talking and unfriend/block me.

Just want to make sure that if I join a protest I'm not supporting Hamas when I chant free palestine and call for an intifada.",09/11/23 18:18:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17rjb1b/free_palestine_from_whowhat/,3,122,337,Oct 7,top,all
17l3xzs,'Bring them home now': Pressure mounts on Netanyahu to prioritize Israeli hostages,"By Alexander Smith and Chantal Da Silva  
TEL AVIV — Across the street from the Israeli Ministry of Defense, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was telling the nation in a speech to prepare for a long and hard war in the Gaza Strip, the chanting was loud, relentless and urgent.  
  
At a demonstration near the ministry’s imposing tower Saturday, two people with megaphones repeated “Bring them home now!” for at least 20 minutes. A hundreds-strong crowd echoed, “Now!”  
  
As Israel intensifies its ground operation against Hamas and bombards Gaza from the air, it is simultaneously working to defend those actions to a world outraged by a spiraling humanitarian crisis. But perhaps the most acute pressure on Netanyahu comes from the families of the 240 Israelis still being held hostage.  
  
Their imprisonment since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 is one factor fueling the Israeli anger against the country’s embattled leader. In addition to blaming Netanyahu for failing to protect Israelis from the assault, many think he has not been sufficiently proactive, sympathetic or communicative with families of the captives. A growing number also disapprove of prioritizing a military campaign in Gaza over the hostages’ safe return.  
  
Michael Levy, whose younger brother, Or, 33, is believed to be among those held hostage, said he fears his brother could be killed or injured in the crossfire.  
“How can you not?” Levy, 40, told NBC News at the demonstration. “I know that my brother and the other hostages are inside.”  
Most Israelis want to see Hamas destroyed to ensure it never carries out another massacre — even if that requires a military operation killing thousands of Palestinians. That’s according to Israeli polling that backs up interviews conducted by NBC News journalists on the ground.

18tovia,Some Key Points to Drive a Centrist Perspective,"After discussion with a Zionist friend, here are some key points that I think help bridge the gap between the typical de facto Zionist perspective and the international humanitarian consensus:



1. Mythos of Proto and Early Israel: There are two key differences between the Israeli perspective and international scholarship regarding violence and the expulsion of Palestinians known as the Nakba. The genesis of Israel was indeed preceded by pogroms and attacks against Jewish immigrants to Palestine by Palestinian Arabs. It is not true, however, that this was one-sided violence. Just as some Arab paramilitaries sought to expel the Jewish immigrants that arrived from the late 19th Century onwards, so too did some Jewish immigrants, influenced by Theodor Herzl's vision of a wholly Jewish Israel, form paramilitaries to attack Palestinian civilians. We need only look at the events in the leadup to the Nakba: it was in response to the Fajja Bus Attacks, wherein Palestinian gunmen attacked two buses and killed 7 Jews. However, this was, in turn, likely retaliation for the asssassination of a prominent Palestinian family by the Zionist paramilitary group Lehi. It was Lehi and fellow Zionist paramilitaries Haganah and Irgun that led the Nakba\*. Contrary to the conventional Israeli narrative, this was not just the result of the Arab Invasion, but the casus belli for it - nearly half of the the estimated 700,000 displaced Palestinians had been displaced prior to May 1948. This is a fact generally accepted by international historians - and also by the ""New Historians"" of Israeli academia, including such names as Avi Shlaim, Benny Morris, and Ilan Pappe. The history of proto and early Israel is thus not one of being victimized, but of active participation in a cycle of escalating violence.
2. Hypocrisy of the ""Innocent Civilian"": Some Zionists have argued that, since Gazan civilians had elected Hamas in 2006, they are partially complicit in Hamas' actions on Oct. 7th. Ignoring the role Israel had to play in Hamas' creation (and the US's complicity in its further radicalization), the argument that political selection affects the removal of personhood is logically inconsistent with simultaneous claims that Hamas is a tyrannical terror organization and that the wanton massacre of innocent Israeli civilians was something terrible. We know that Hamas no longer rules by democratic vote. Its tyranny is another reason why it is a despicable organization. We also hold Israeli civilians to be innocent and wholly undeserving of slaughter despite participation in a much more democratic process. This is presumably because we do not hold them individually accountable for any mis-steps that the IDF and Knesset make. Then, the same should be extended to Gazan civilians with respect to Hamas.
3. Foreseen vs. Intended Harm: The argument that the killing of the civilians is not intended, but merely a necessary consequence of attacking Hamas is not convincing. Suppose I visit the Grand Canyon with my family. While we are all looking over the edge, I thrust my arms out and push my father over the edge and he falls to his death. Upon questioning by my family, I say that it was not so bad because I did not intend to push him off the cliff. Instead, I merely wanted a better view and some more arm space. This does not seem a convincing reason nor does it make my action much better. Similarly, bombing recklessly with full knowledge that you will kill mostly civilians is not much better than doing it because killing civilians makes you happy.
4. Contextualization of Harms: At this point, it is important to address the argument that ""war is war"". Simply put, this view states that casualties of innocents are a necessary consequence of war. To put in context the rate of suffering inflicted, we can compare it with other conflicts. The recorded civilian death toll in Gaza is already more than double the civilian death toll from Russia's two-year long invasion of Ukraine. To date, other notable statistics include the 65 journalists and 136 UN workers killed by Israel. For reference, 63 journalists were killed over the 20 years of the two Vietnam Wars and 67 journalists were killed covering Allied forces in WW2. Just 18 were killed in the Korean War. Alternately, 136 is by far the most workers ever killed in a UN operation (88 was already a record way back in early November). What is happening in Gaza is not ""just war"". It is historical.
5. False Dichotomy of Supremacy and Extinction: There seems to be some rationalization of what is occurring as necessary to ensure the continued existence of Israel. The events of 10/7 were horrible and they were terrifying. This is the nature of a terrorist attack. 9/11 did not represent a legimiate threat to the existence of the United States. 10/7 did not represent a legitimate threat to the existence of Israel as a state. Alternately, the point might possibly be reframed as something like ""any threat to sovereignty and national strength risks the possibility of losing the state and, thereby, the extinction of the Jewish people"". Some variant of this argument is the only other logically consistent way I see the rationalization of Israel's Gaza attacks. The link between statehood and existence of a people is not so strong. Neither is that between the existence of supremacy of a state and its existence. The cessation of hostilities might impact the supremacy of Israel over Gaza, but it does not threaten Israel's existence and it would not threaten the existence of the Israeli or Jewish people. If fear is driven in part by evidence of Palestine losing statehood and its people's subsequent conditions, this is a self-fulfilling fear. The international community does not intend for Israel to lose statehood or for its people to suffer. At the same time, safety for Israelis does not require the obliteration of Gazans.

\*Lehi was responsible for the assassination of the UN-appointed mediator Count Folke Bernadotte. Bernadotte had been appointed since he had negotiated the release of over 30,000 prisoners from Nazi concentration camps during WW2, many of which were Jews. Lehi deemed him too pro-Palestinian and shot him.

Irgun was responsible for the King David Hotel bombing which killed 91 in the British Mandatory Offices. The purpose of the bombing was to destroy documents incriminating the Jewish Agency in attacks against the British.

Haganah bombed the SS Patria, an oceanliner carrying Jewish refugees because they wanted to prevent them from being sent to Mauritius until they could receive papers. 267 died as a result.

The list of terror attacks by each organization is long. Notable Jewish intellectuals including Albert Einstein and Hannah Arendt regarded them as terror groups. Continuity between the leadership of the paramilitaries and that of Israel was significant. For exampel, one of the three planners of the Bernadotte assassination was Yitzhak Shamir, the 7th prime minister of Israel.",29/12/23 14:53:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18tovia/some_key_points_to_drive_a_centrist_perspective/,1,38,1148,Oct 7,top,all

187bj45,Diasporas: can Jews and Palestinians outside Israel/Gaza help moderate extremism?,"My question is what role or responsibilities might we see from these larger communities outside the war zone? 

1) the Jewish people I know in a US city tend to hate Bibi and have moderate, informed views. They also tend to have higher incomes, and there’s a virtual cycle of investment and entrepreneurship.

2) I don’t know the Palestinian diaspora as well. Let’s break it into 2: A) those in higher income countries so people have some means. And secondly B) those in adjacent countries or non Gaza/non border refugee camps. 

Typical all diasporas wire money home. 2B is highly affected by Israel’s blockage, and lack of mobility. Not sure if they harbor MORE extremism. My guess is overall this diaspore doesn’t have a lot of excess wealth and ability in expensive other countries. But they are in-group, can send aid, and can write, pressure, bridge and work to move away from extremism.

What are the roles of these groups? And also, I’m wondering how co-opted they are by the “3rd war”. Thomas Friedman wrote

“That third war is the one that scares me the most.

It’s the war between Iran and its proxies — Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Shiite militias in Iraq — against America, Israel and the moderate Arab states of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the U.A.E. and Bahrain.

This war is not only about hegemony, raw power and energy sources but also about values. Israel, at its best, and America, at its best, represent the promotion of Western humanistic concepts of women’s empowerment, multiethnic democracy, pluralism, religious tolerance and the rule of law — which are a direct threat to Iran’s misogynist Islamic theocracy, which demonstrates daily its ruthless willingness to jail or even kill Iranian women for not sufficiently covering their hair.

And while Arab allies of America and Israel are not democracies — and do not aspire to be — their leaders are all on a journey away from the old model of building legitimacy through resistance — resistance to Israel, to America, to Iran and Iranian-backed Shiites — and toward building their legitimacy on delivering resilience for all their people (through education, skills and growing environmental awareness) so they may realize their full potential.

That is not Iran’s agenda. The raw power dimension is over who will be the hegemon, i.e. the big dog, in the region — Shiite Iran, tied to Russia and extending its reach to Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, or Sunni Arab-dominated Saudi Arabia in a tacit alliance with Bahrain, the U.A.E., Jordan, Egypt and Israel and all backed by America. In this third war, Iran’s goal is to drive the United States out of the Middle East, to destroy Israel and to intimidate America’s Sunni Arab allies and bend them to its will.

In this war, America is projecting its power through our two aircraft carrier groups now stationed in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Iran is countering us with what I call landcraft carriers — a network of proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, the West Bank, Yemen and Iraq serving as platforms for launching rocket attacks on U.S. forces and Israel every bit as lethal as those from our aircraft carriers.

This third war started to escalate on Sept. 14, 2019, when Iran launched an audacious, unprovoked drone attack against two major Saudi Aramco oil processing facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais. The Trump administration did nothing. “That was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn’t an attack on us,” Donald Trump said. On Jan. 17, 2022, Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi militia attacked the United Arab Emirates with missiles and drones, igniting a fire near the Abu Dhabi airport and setting off explosions in fuel trucks that killed three people. Again, no U.S. response.

So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that on Oct. 7, Hamas dared to launch its murderous attack on Israel’s western border; shortly after, Iran’s proxy Hezbollah began daily missile attacks along Israel’s northern border, and the Houthis began launching drones at Israel’s southern tip, seized a ship in the Red Sea and attacked two others.”

Since 7 Oct 2023, there has been discussion and action on the international stage with regard to the possibility of Gaza citizens leaving Gaza. For example, Egyptian president el-Sisi said on 18 Oct 2023 that moving the population of Gaza to Egypt could result in a situation where “Israel would have the right to defend itself and its national security and therefore directly strike Egyptian lands.”

However, the question remains: with all of Gaza's citizens displaced, where will they eventually go? Ultimately, they will either be in Gaza or out of Gaza.

17xijin,Hamas' standard negotiating tactics aren't working as they did in the past,"Historically, Hamas could exchange one israeli captive for hundreds of prisoners. That was in fact the ultimate goal of the Oct 7 massacare - to release all Palestinian prisoners. On Oct 7 a Hamas spokesperson boasted that they have enough hostages to release every single Palestinian.

The brutality of the massacre however changed the equation. Not only is there no chance that Israel will release thousands of prisoners, the standard negotiation has shifted. In the past, Israel would have agreed to Hamas' current demands -- release 50 hostages at a pace of their own choosing in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.

Today, though, Israel is sticking firm that there wil be no ceasefire without a release of all or at least a majority of hostages. Meanwhile, Israel's assault on Gaza continues. 

The question is - will Hamas agree to a massive hostage release or will it remain prideful and let Gaza be picked apart day by day?",17/11/23 16:13:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17xijin/hamas_standard_negotiating_tactics_arent_working/,2,58,156,Oct 7,top,all

181dirv,Hamas is using the palestinians as human shields is predicated on the claim that they are abettors?,"Pro-Israel people (myself included) are making the argument that Israel must defend its people from Hamas after what happened on Oct. 7, and therefore must eliminate the organization by blowing up their command centers and targeting their infrastructure and killing the terrorrists. There's the obvious problem of the palestinian civilians, since Hamas is hiding underneath hospitals and busy cities to amplify the civilian casualties just so they can show the world how ""cruel"" the Israelis are.

Now the counter-argument from the pro-Israel movement is that Hamas is using the palestinians as human shields. I always understood this argument as saying that although the palestinian civilians are innocent, Israel must still eliminate the Hamas threat at the cost of innocent civilians, since Israel is not targeting the innocent civilians, on the contrary, Israel is trying to avoid as many civilian deaths possible, they are merely used by Hamas as human shields, the blame lies with Hamas, not Israel. This is the cost of war. Some have even compared this to the allied bombing of Dresden, it was unfortunate that so many civilians died, but it had to be done to end the war and with it the atrocities of the Nazi regime. So the German civilian deaths that were caused were somewhat justified.

But upon introspection I realized that the argument really rests on the claim that the majority of the palestinian people are abettors in crime; once you remove that claim, the rest of the argument falls apart. Imagine Hamas would be hiding in a french town, would Israel be able to make the argument that they must eliminate the Hamas at the cost of french people's lives, since they are being used as human shields? Clearly not! So the crucial element here is the *palestinian people.* And the reason for that could only be because Israel is viewing them as abettors in crime. True, they say, we are not targeting the civilians, targeting them would be morally wrong. All we are doing is eliminating the terrorists, but since they are hiding underneath civilian cities it is unavoidable that some civilians will be killed, but they are not completely innocent either, as they are encouraging this behavior and have voted them in, etc. So causing civilian deaths as collateral damage is not morally unjustifiable.

So my question is, does the argument really boil down to the claim that the palestinian people are also culpable and therefore causing unintentional death as collateral damage is permissible, or have I completely misunderstood the argument?",22/11/23 16:41:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/181dirv/hamas_is_using_the_palestinians_as_human_shields/,1,59,421,Oct 7,top,all

Also, typically they would release their own videos but still have not seen that either. All I recall is footage before the conflict where they wear the green headbands and the tragic videos when they entered Israel on Oct. 7, but after that I have not come across one bit of them.

18td9gb,Why can't Israel use this strategy to avoid casualties?,"""We certainly all recognize more can be done to try to reduce civilian casualties, and we're going to keep working with our Israeli counterparts to that end,"" [said National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/israel-can-do-more-to-reduce-civilian-casualties-in-gaza-white-house/3077688)\
I know the US already has some concrete suggestions for reducing casualties but I'm wondering why the no one is suggesting the following plan. Seem like it could avoid both civilian casualties and Israeli troop losses.\
Now that north Gaza is evacuated send in Israeli troops to destroy the tunnels and setup a good security solution. With modern surveillance and drone technology you should be able to automate a lot of the grunt work of occupation. Setup a security checkpoint at the boundary between north and south Gaza. Then bring people from south Gaza to north Gaza while checking them for weapons. Once south Gaza is evacuated destroy the tunnels in South Gaza and setup security in south gaza.\
  

It seems to me that  the current strategy of warning before bombing can't work because hamas militants will also get that warning and leave. Also, they told civilians to go to south gaza and then bombed south gaza anyways [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-bomb-investigation.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-bomb-investigation.html).
This is not the point of my post but for context the US has suggested:  
- use smaller bombs  
- gather more intelligence before bombing  
- use commandos  
\
One counter argument I can think of is that this does not involve killing any hamas millitants.Just destroying tunnels, setting up security infrastructure, and taking over governance. But even if you did kill all the Hamas militants more would come. The current strategy isn't very good at killing hamas millitants anyways. So far they have killed 7000 out of 30000 hamas fighters. [https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-bombs-destruction-death-toll-scope-419488c511f83c85baea22458472a796#:\~:text=Eleven%20weeks%20into%20the%20war,way%20to%20free%20more%20hostages](https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-bombs-destruction-death-toll-scope-419488c511f83c85baea22458472a796#:~:text=Eleven%20weeks%20into%20the%20war,way%20to%20free%20more%20hostages). At that rate they'd kill 85000 civilians to finish.Some might think transportation is an issue but walking from Khan Yunis to Jabalia takes 6 hours.

Some would argue that Israel can deter future attacks by killing more civilians but this is immoral and would probably not work.

Update:
Based on the comments I now realize that no one is suggesting this because there are no centrists looking for better solutions. There are only people who want ceasefire and people who can't hear any critique Israeli policy.

A core point of disagreement is how quickly more gazans would become terrorists. Also how many hamas fighters are undercover as civilians and not currently fighting so that no intelligence could reveal them. I'm not sure but maybe a lot less with my plan which would minimize civilian casualties!

Another common point is that this plan would take too long but you have to do all these steps at some point anyways.

Some say this would put Israeli troops in danger. Yes but not much more than what the danger the had at checkpoints everyday before Oct 7. Hamas has attacked a security checkpoint before but it's rare because it's hard to attack one and survive.",29/12/23 03:38:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18td9gb/why_cant_israel_use_this_strategy_to_avoid/,0,143,487,Oct 7,top,all
17ies6k,Minimizing Civilian Casualties,"Modern conflicts are being fought not only in the field but also in mass/social media and that is where Israel consistently loses. I think it happens for several reasons that include:

1. not so good Hasbara (explaining what Israel does and why) which is probably limited to avoid revealing intelligence to the other side. I do not believe they spread fake news and do not know if they use bots and AI to spread pro-Israeli propaganda. I get the feeling Hamas and its supporters do both on a massive scale.
2. civilian casualties

2 is what I want to focus on.

IMO Israel should do all in its power to minimize civilian casualties. Sadly, I'm afraid only a minority on both sides would agree with the statement ""civilian lives matter"". Most believe the other side wants them dead or sees them as less than human or simply does not care because they are not of the same nationality. There's also the vengeance factor, which both sides feel, it's ok to feel that way but acting on it would only result in an infinite cycle of bloodshed. 

After the war is over there will be over 2m Gazan civilians who will most likely remain in Gaza and it is in the best interests for Israel that this population does not seek vengeance after this war and give birth to a new Hamas. One way to do that is to do the opposite of what Hamas expects - show Gazans that Israel DOES care about Gazan population and that it is Hamas they are fighting against.

One way to do this is construct a large refugee camp on Israeli land east of Gaza strip that would harbor 300-500k. It could be constructed south of Rafah on the border with Egypt. It would be surrounded with a fence and some military presence outside it. The UN could be tasked with building the camp. They spend over $500m in aid each year in Gaza and with coming aid it could be well over $1b. They have over 13k employees and can send additional personnel. The refugee camp would be supplied with electricity through generators, water and food through either Egypt or Israel. It could take time to build it, but not significant time as refugee camps have sprung rather quickly in the past.

Evacuate Gazans into the refugee camp from the northern strip. They would be checked on entry for weapons. There could be Hamas members joining, but then they won't be able to carry arms or harm the refugees. Hamas may try to prevent them from going to the refugee camps, but it'd be much harder for them to hide this from the world if Gazans have sufficient incentives to evacuate. 

Have Israel clear the northern strip from Hamas fighters and tunnels then allow the refugees back in. There will need to be a buffer where ground forces would be stationed so letting refugees back and evacuating the southern strip will be a gradual process as the forces move south.

Any Israeli soldier with relatives or friends who were casualties on Oct. 7 or have radical political opinions should not be allowed to take part in the fighting without appropriate psychological evaluation. This is to minimize incidents of theft, property damage or other war crimes during the incursion.

This way the civilian casualties would be minimized greatly as never before seen in a conflict and win Israel the support it needs to end the war on its terms. It's likely most Gazans will continue to have anti-Israeli sentiment, but much less so than with airstrikes and invasion without evacuation. 

This solution would probably come at a great political cost to Israel, but great politicians would sacrifice their careers for their country if need be and a conflict like this would be a good time as any, especially for someone like Bibi to redeem himself and go down in history as a great leader who did the right thing.

I know it's a fantasy and would likely never happen, but is it really that far fetched? ",28/10/23 14:20:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17ies6k/minimizing_civilian_casualties/,1,4,682,Oct 7,top,all
18mnubz,Processing my thoughts,"Since Oct 7 I feel like I have had lots of mixed emotions about what’s going on and I haven’t been able to get them off my chest. I want to start this off by saying I just want to process my thoughts and feelings about what’s going on because I am a Jew in America but I have conflicted emotions and just kind of need to vent.

I feel grief, sadness, a little bit of guilt, and confusion. Confused for the future and sad for the innocent life that has been lost in unfathomable amounts. I feel almost guilty for being Jewish knowing what the Israeli government is doing basically in the name of Judaism.

One of my biggest thoughts is that there are radicals on both sides. I struggle when I see my friends supporting Israel unequivocally maybe without acknowledging the Palestinian deaths and what has happened to them for the last 75 years. However I do still support the innocent people of Israel but I also support the innocent Palestinians who have been affected the most. This past summer I visited Israel, and they tried to teach us about the war from their perspective. I met some IDF soldiers who didn’t want to be fighting themselves. And this is another thing, I see a lot of people online who think the whole IDF is bad because of the bad apples. I’m not defending the bad ones who do horrific things, however I now have friends in the IDF who I know are good people and wouldn’t do those bad things and it makes me sad seeing people generalize them.

But it also pains me when I see online people who will say things like “You’re a jew who cares what you think” or “Hitler should’ve finished the job” and might say this in the name of the Palestinian cause. I know not all Palestinian supporters are antisemitic, I would be a fool if I did believe that. I am not the victim here but I am scared with the rise of antisemitism. I have also seen comments online where people just post videos of themselves wrapping tefillin (a Jewish thing that more religious people do, I am not that religious) and have nothing to do with the war and get called a dirty jew or a Zionist.

Maybe some people might say my feelings aren’t valid or this and that but while I believe Hamas is a horrible terrorist group who does want to get rid of the Jews all over the world, the people running the Israel government have prejudice towards the Palestinians as well and don’t see those people equal to themselves. I just want this war to end as much as the next guy. I want Jews and Muslims in the Middle East to coexist peacefully. I want the Israel government to stop having hate towards the Palestinians and I want the people who hate Jews in the Middle East to stop having hate towards the Jews.

17iowcr,"""Our Souls Mean Nothing At All""","[Nicholas Kristof](https://archive.ph/s8ljA):

The most consequential decision Israel will face in the coming days is how hard to continue hitting Gaza. Should it undertake a monthslong ground invasion? Continue with large-scale aerial bombardment? Allow fuel into Gaza to keep hospitals running?
Over the last week that I’ve spent reporting in Israel and the West Bank, I’ve tried to listen and learn. So let me share why I believe we’ll some day look back at this moment and see a profound moral and policy failure.

But let me start with someone smart who has a different take.

Ehud Barak, the former Israeli general, defense minister and prime minister, knows more about the military challenges of taking on Gaza than almost anybody. In 2009 he oversaw a major ground offensive against Hamas. I dropped by his home in Tel Aviv, and we sat in his office, surrounded by his collection of framed cartoons mocking him — he has a thick skin — as he argued in favor of a ground invasion as the only way to crush Hamas.

“There is no way but to send many tens of thousands of boots on the ground,” he said, but he acknowledged that this will be a prolonged and bloody task. He estimated that there is a 50 percent chance that it will lead to a war with Hezbollah in the north, plus some risk of attacks from militias on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights and of serious unrest on the West Bank.

Barak also warned that after a number of months when Israel might be ready to withdraw from Gaza, it could have trouble handing the territory over to someone else. But it’s conceivable, he said, that Israel could find a multilateral Arab force to take over Gaza and that this force could eventually transfer control of the territory to the Palestinian Authority. On balance, he thinks that it is possible for Israel to destroy most of Hamas’s capabilities, establish a no-go zone along the border and extricate itself.

For my part, I’m skeptical that either the invasion or the handover would go well, partly because I’ve observed so many military operations that started optimistically and ended as bloody quagmires. But Barak also made another important point: Israel will now finally end Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policy of bolstering Hamas.
What? Israel supported Hamas?

Yes, under Netanyahu, Israel approved the transfer of over $1 billion to Gaza from Qatar — intended to cover expenses such as salaries and energy costs — but some funds reached Hamas’ military wing, Ha’aretz reported. (Qatar has denied that the money was misused.) Netanyahu’s aim, according to Barak and others, was to buttress Hamas so as to weaken the rival Palestinian Authority and undermine any possibility of a two-state solution. “Those who want to thwart the possibility of a Palestinian state should support the strengthening of Hamas and the transfer of money to Hamas,” Netanyahu reportedly said in 2019.

That monetary lifeline to Hamas will now surely be cut, and that may hurt the organization as much as any number of bombs.

Israel has the right to defend itself and strike military targets in Gaza, and there should be strong international pressure on Hamas to release its hostages. My reporting in Gaza over the years convinces me that Gazans themselves would be much better off if Hamas could be removed: Some American liberals don’t appreciate how repressive, misogynistic, homophobic and economically incompetent Hamas is in Gaza, to say nothing of its long history of terror attacks on Israel. All this explains why many Gazans are fed up with Hamas.

“Hamas spends money building tunnels, not investing in people,” a Gaza woman told me. She was stuck in Jerusalem, where her young son was receiving cancer treatment at a Palestinian hospital.

The despair in Gaza, she said, is such that for years some young men have simply dreamed of becoming “martyrs” and winning honor by killing Israelis.

“In Gaza, there is no hope,” she said. “There is no life, there is nothing we have from living in Gaza. The only thing people can do is become a martyr.”

The woman, whom I’m not identifying for fear of retaliation by Hamas, says that she is against the killing of civilians on either side, and that now she weeps each day as she follows the bombing of Gaza and wonders if her husband and other children there will survive. Her son with cancer was sitting a few feet away, watching videos on his mom’s phone, and I looked over to see what he was watching.

It was TikToks of his neighborhood being bombed.

He was glued to the screen as videos showed areas the size of multiple football fields near his home turned into rubble; satellite imagery shows other large areas pulverized as well. No one knows how many people are caught in the wreckage, but some Gazans told me they had heard cries from inside collapsed buildings. They lack proper equipment to rescue people, so eventually, the cries stop, and a stench rises.

Despite her own opposition to Hamas, the woman said that anger at the Israeli attacks will probably boost support for Hamas in the territory.

One well-educated young woman inside Gaza, Amal, told me over WhatsApp that the victims she knew of were mostly civilians, and she sounded full of despair.

“Constant bombardment has me feeling as if I am not human anymore, as if our souls mean nothing at all,” she told me. “We are being massacred.”

A 16-year-old girl in Gaza offered this message, conveyed through Save the Children: “It’s like we are overpaying the price for a sin we didn’t commit. We were always with peace and will always be.”

As Israel stands poised to escalate the war, there are two arguments to think through. The first is pragmatic: Can a siege and large-scale ground invasion succeed in erasing Hamas?

I’m skeptical, and when I hear backers of an invasion speak of removing Hamas I have the same sinking feeling as when I heard hawks in 2002 and 2003 cheerily promising to liberate Iraq. Just because it would be good to eliminate a brutal regime doesn’t mean it is readily achievable; the Taliban can confirm that.

The answers to the question of who will take over a battered Gaza after months of warfare also seem too iffy to me. It won’t be Egypt, said the former Egyptian foreign minister Nabil Fahmy.

“I can’t imagine any international force being ready to take on what’s left there,” Fahmy told me. He thinks an Israeli invasion is unlikely to destroy Hamas and is more likely to inflame radicalism in Gaza, and he warns that President Biden has damaged American standing in the region because of his perceived indifference to Palestinian lives.

The second prism through which to consider the Gaza war is a moral one, for we have values as well as interests. Decades from now when we look back at this moment, I suspect it’s the moral failures that we may most regret — the inability of some on the left (and many in the Arab world) to condemn the barbaric Oct. 7 attacks on Israelis, and the acceptance by so many Americans and Israelis that countless children and civilians must pay with their lives in what Netanyahu described as Israel’s “mighty vengeance.”

When Israeli Jews were asked in a poll whether the suffering of Palestinian civilians should be taken into account in planning the war on Gaza, 83 percent said “not at all” or “not so much.” I can’t help feeling that while we say that all lives have equal value, President Biden has likewise greatly prioritized Israeli children over Gazan children.

I give Biden great credit for promptly moving two aircraft carrier groups to the region, to help deter Hezbollah or others from joining the war. The White House was right to condemn the “grotesque” and “antisemitic” messages on some college campuses. And Biden’s compassion for victims of the Hamas attacks was so heartfelt that he built up political capital in Israel — but so far he hasn’t leveraged it to get significant aid into Gaza.

The United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres, has condemned what he called “clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza.” The Biden administration, which in the context of Ukraine constantly speaks of international law, vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for humanitarian pauses to deliver aid.

Every account I’ve heard from Gaza this past week, including directly from people there who despise Hamas, suggests that the civilian toll there has been horrendous. One gauge is that at least 53 United Nations staff members have been killed so far, including teachers, an engineer, a psychologist and a gynecologist. More than 20 journalists have been killed, too, and an Al Jazeera correspondent lost his wife, son, daughter and grandson to an airstrike.

And now the suffering in Gaza is set to get much worse.

That’s partly because hospitals are running out of diesel fuel, and Israel is not allowing fuel into the territory. I understand the reason: Hamas could use diesel fuel for its attacks on Israelis, and an Israeli military spokesman also told me that United Nations alarmists may be exaggerating the shortage. Yet if hospitals lack fuel and cannot operate generators, babies in incubators may die along with people needing dialysis or surgeries. Some 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza would face greater risks if hospitals can’t take them.

“We are on the brink of collapse,” Philippe Lazzarini, who runs the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, the largest aid agency in Gaza, told me.

Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, lead physician in Gaza for the aid group MedGlobal, put it this way, “When the fuel runs out tomorrow, this hospital will rapidly become a mass grave.”

Because of the siege, Gaza is also running out of insulin and anesthetic, according to Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization.

Fadi Abu Shammalah, who works in Gaza with a civil society organization called Just Vision, visited the United States this year at the invitation of the State Department, presumably because he was seen as a potential bridge across cultures. “I love you,” he told me over the phone, speaking of Americans. “You are so kind to me.”
I thanked him but noted that we were also providing some of the bombs being dropped near him. He said he doubted that the Americans he so admired understood how the war was actually playing out against civilians.

“Is it a war against Hamas, really?” he asked. “Or it’s against my kids?” He said that as bombs dropped, he tried to calm his terrified children by saying that if they could hear the explosions, they were safe; it’s the bombs you never hear that kill you. That backfired; when there was silence, the children feared they were about to be obliterated.

“One of the reasons the Oct. 7 attacks were so horrible was because adult men slaughtered children,” said Sari Bashi of Human Rights Watch. “But adult men are slaughtering children every day in Gaza by dropping bombs on their homes.”

Israel faces an agonizing challenge: A neighboring territory is ruled by well-armed terrorists who have committed unimaginable atrocities, aim to commit more and now shelter in tunnels beneath a population of more than two million people. It’s a nightmare. But the sober question must be: What policies will reduce the risk, not inflame it, while honoring the intrinsic value of Palestinian life as well as Israeli life?

People will answer that question in different ways, and I don’t claim to have all the answers. But I think some day we will look back in horror at both the Hamas butchery in Israel and at the worsening tableau of suffering in Gaza in which we are complicit.",28/10/23 22:31:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17iowcr/our_souls_mean_nothing_at_all/,0,3,1980,Oct 7,top,all
1av1cmh,The only way forward ,"So I’ve been gathering my thoughts on the recent conflict, my role as an American in it, as well as the reactions of my contemporaries. I’m not sure if this subreddit is the best place to communicate them but I wanted to say my piece. 

Both Hamas and Israel suck. The left and right pick sides like a sport team, leaving the lives of both Israeli and Palestinian civilians at risk. 

I’ll start with Israel first as they actually have a functioning government and significantly more and better resources. The blame for this attack; in its entirety, falls on bibi’s shoulders. He knew this attack was being planned, he gave aid to Hamas knowing something was coming. Bibi built his entire career off of the Palestinian struggle. As long as the Gazans were violent Bibi and his party would stay in power. Bibi is violence. He has to keep the cycle of violence continuing to stay in power. He killed Rabim and he’ll kill all of Israel to stay in power. While Hamas hides in tunnel, the IDF murders civilians, and delays the destruction of the tunnel network. Bibi set an arbitrary goal as the end of the campaign. Yet in his quest to decimate Hamas he secures a new base for them for generations to come. No one has been better at Hamas recruitment than Benjamin Netanyahu. The war will never end as long as Bibi and the Likud remain in power.

Now Hamas. Gaza hasn’t seen an election since 2006. Look at their population pyramid the majority of Gazans weren’t alive for the last election. Hamas doesn’t share the interest of their people. That’s why they can’t have free elections. Since hamas can’t compete with Israel straight up, they use their own people as shields while they lay in their tunnels unharmed. The attack on Oct 7th was disgusting. But the logic behind it is truly demonic. Hamas leads their entire population to slaughter, knowing after the Oct 7 attack what the Israeli response would be. Hamas strategy is clear and simple. They let their people get slaughtered, knowing that their citizens would put all of it online. Effectively deputizing every victim. This isn’t a war of blood and metal but of heart and mind. Same strategy as Vietnam and MLK, instigate violence upon yourself, then use the unreasonable blood shed to make it impossible for your enemy to justify their fight. The fact that we fell for this again is the biggest justification for history classes. 

We should feel sympathy for the civilians of Gaza, but not of Hamas. We should support our Israeli allies, not the Likud. Anti-Zionism is not antisemitism and we should oppose both antisemitism and Islamophobia where they stand. The only way forward is for Israel to reject the Likud, for free and fair elections in Gaza, the end of Israeli colonialism, and a unified Arabian front backed by the UN to ensure peace within Gaza’s borders while they rebuild and change their political system. Personally I will always oppose theocracies. The most religious states tend to be the most violent, but there is potential for peace in the Middle East. Should the Likud leave office, a new party can reignite Israeli diplomatic ties. And a Jewish-Sunni alliance can strengthen American foreign policy and effectively isolate the more violent Shia regimes. The Middle East could be an economic, academic, and tourist powerhouse if they’d at least act unified. 

TLDR; UN enforced free elections in Gaza, Israeli rejection of Likud, regional support, rejection of Israeli colonialism and a move towards political stability in the Middle East ",19/02/24 22:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1av1cmh/the_only_way_forward/,1,57,602,Oct 7,top,all
17zas6b,Retorts to Zionist Propaganda,"I've noticed repetitive rhetoric from a lot of people I've encountered online. Here are my answers to most of these repeated talking points. This may be updated, going forward...

&#x200B;

* **The conflict is so complicated and you don't truly understand it.**

This is usually followed by a detail that makes Israel out to be a fair and innocent party, trying just to do good and defend itself. But in short, the conflict is not complicated. All of its small details may be complex.

However, even in those small details, you can see evidence over and over of Israeli lies and propaganda. For example, did you know that [Israel purposefully attacked a United States communications vessel](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA499280.pdf) during the Six-Day War? Yes. That's a complicated little piece of information.

No matter how complicated various little tidbits of facts are -- facts that can be twisted and halfway-represented to form whatever narrative Zionists are spouting -- at its core, *this issue is one of a colonial power in the cruel, drawn-out process of stealing land from indigenous people.*

And that's not complex.

&#x200B;

* **Anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Jews need a safe state of their own to live in, and being against that idea is being against Jews.**

Many Jews are against the idea of an ethnostate being founded in their name. Some are religiously against it, such as [Neturei Karta](https://www.nkusa.org/). Some are secularly against it, in the name of humanitarian ethics that demand freedom and agency for every member of a country, rather than an apartheid ethnostate based on race. Some aren't against a Jewish ethnostate ever existing, but are completely against the state of Israel in particular due to the incalculably cruel histories of its founding as well as its current policies.

Look into [IfNotNow](https://www.ifnotnowmovement.org/) and [Jewish Voice for Peace](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/), which are two of the Jewish organizations that protest Zionism alongside Neturei Karta. Look up the observantly-Jewish voices of respected sociological and political thinkers like [Gabor Mate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHDBw-wx6w0), [Ilan Pappe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK7jckzam5c), [Noman Finkelstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZGPZRkqJzY), and [Noam Chomsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbWoWSRDCIk).

[Mondoweiss](https://mondoweiss.net/) is a site that posts pro-Palestine news and opinion pieces written mainly by Jews. [The Gray Zone](https://thegrayzone.com/) is a subversive website headed by Max Blumenthal, a Jew, that posts highly critical pieces on the Israeli occupation and uncovers a lot of what is hidden by the mainstream media. [Breaking the Silence](https://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/) is a database of ex-IDF soldiers who are coming out as whistleblowers against the cruel oppression that is part-and-parcel of Israeli military occupation.

Stop pretending that ""Jewish"" and ""Israeli"" are interchangeable words. Judaism is a beautiful Abrahamic faith, that like all other Abrahamic faiths, at its core teaches peace and love and kindness. Many followers of these faiths cherry-pick their religions in order to follow their whims. However, the religion itself is one of generosity and love and submission to God's will: and many Jews follow their religion, and do not appreciate Israeli oppression, apartheid, and genocide.

&#x200B;

* **The majority of pro-Palestinian activists don't know what they're talking about. They just repeat buzzwords like ""colonialism"" and ""apartheid"" because it's the cool thing to do. They're wannabe revolutionaries and they'll grow up and learn.**

This is not true. For one thing, those buzzwords carry meaning. Genocide is a real thing.

For another thing, demeaning an activity as ""the cool thing to do"" and scorning people as just jumping on bandwagons is a way to appeal to the [conservative brain](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72980-x#:~:text=Neuroimaging%20studies%20have%20shown%20that,while%20making%20risky%20decisions14) \-- and I know this, because I have a stubborn conservative brain myself. It takes active effort to learn new things and change my mind. As a teenager, I actually thought the Palestinians should just leave the land to Israel and stop fighting over it and share. I didn't like how Israel was killing people, but in my mind the answer was clear: just leave.

I'm not a wannabe revolutionary, and neither are the majority of people struggling for justice in this world. That's a ridiculous and childish attack on people's genuine well-researched convictions.

&#x200B;

* **Palestinians don't want peace; they refused peace agreements several times.**

Palestinians want peace so much that the PA has recognized the state of Israel, which is an invading colonial body that has historically displaced Palestinians from their land. Despite these efforts for peace, there has never actually been any genuine, fair peace offer. Israelis like to talk about the Oslo Accords but although they were the closest to fair, they never truly allowed for the existence of an independent Palestinian State. [Rabin himself, before he was assassinated, stated that there would be no Palestinian statehood.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rabin-formally-opposed-a-palestinian-state-more-than-a-year-after-white-house-handshake-letter-from-1994-shows/)

Zionists like to say that if Rabin had not been assassinated by an Israeli right-winger, Palestine would have peace. But even Rabin would not have allowed Palestine its own freedom and agency.

There are many genuine analyses of this falsehood, and here is one, with [Rashid Khalidi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb8HKNxUtnw).

&#x200B;

* **Hamas went on a rape, murder, and beheading spree on Oct 7, killing upwards of 1200 people.**

There has never been actual proof of Hamas killing that many people, or raping anybody. There has instead been a lot of evidence that the IDF killed the majority of their own people in crossfire and shelling from both military tanks and apache helicopters. [Max Blumenthal has covered this, and there are links throughout this summary as well as more information that can be researched independently.](https://thegrayzone.com/2023/10/27/israels-military-shelled-burning-tanks-helicopters/) All the evidence is out there, and [despite Israeli civilians begging](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-victims-families-urge-icc-investigate-oct-7-hamas-attacks-2023-10-31/) for the International Criminal Court to investigate what truly happened on October 7th, [as well as other countries, Israel refuses to allow the ICC jurisdiction within the country in order to investigate.](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/17/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-crimes-icc-referral/index.html)

&#x200B;

* **Hamas hides behind civilians. That's the only reason that Israel has to bomb so many Gazan civilians, they're totally not trying to cause a genocide.**

Israel has been unable to prove that the headquarters of Hamas were beneath al Shifa hospital as they claimed. Instead we have a [small assortment of random weapons](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3241705/israeli-military-shows-video-weapons-found-gazas-al-shifa-hospital) that could fit in a duffel bag or two and could've been easily planted, a video of what is obviously just [a calendar presented as a hostage-guarding schedule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTcEL1BQ2qc), and a picture of what is [obviously just an elevator shaft presented as a nefarious tunnel](https://www.newsweek.com/did-israel-find-tunnel-under-al-shifa-hospital-what-video-shows-1844583). We have a report from amnesty international stating that no evidence of Hamas using human shields has been found, and actually there are multiple cases of Israel using Palestinian civilians as human shields. [Here's the report by Amnesty International on Israel's human shielding war crimes.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mde151432002en.pdf)

&#x200B;

* **Instead of demanding a ceasefire, people should demand that Hamas surrender to Israel.**

A ceasefire means both sides stop fighting. Sure, Hamas might break it, but Israel might break it too. A ceasefire is actually an unjust temporary measure that freezes an oppressive status quo. It is just temporary and meant to give the civilians a break. Hamas [has asked](https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/4632336-release-hostages-needs-ceasefire-hamas-official-says) for a [short ceasefire](https://www.businessinsider.com/hamas-gaza-offer-50-hostages-5-day-ceasefire-israel-rejected-2023-11) multiple times in order to send the civilian hostages safely back to Israel's side of the wall.

Demanding that Hamas surrender is not only suggesting that any armed resistance to occupation and oppression must stop (regardless of Hamas' particular war crimes) but is tantamount to worsening conditions for all Palestinians, and accepting those worsened conditions as a new status quo.

That is not justice. A ceasefire is not justice either. But at least it will allow the millions of terrorized civilians in the region to have a break. A daily pause is not enough when churches, schools, hospitals, and refugee camps are being bombed -- when journalists are being targeted -- when over five thousand children have been slaughtered just since the beginning of this bombing campaign by Israel.

&#x200B;

* **Anyone supporting a free Palestine is actually supporting Hamas.**

Anyone supporting a free Palestine is actually supporting the removal of Hamas, because if Palestine was free then they would not need or desire any armed resistance to the occupation. For decades, Palestinians persisted in mostly peaceful means of negotiating and protesting apartheid. Israel constantly responded with death and brutality. The majority of pro-Palestine supporters do not support Hamas at all, and find their methods to be unconscionable -- but truthfully recognize Israeli oppression as the root of the conflict in the region.

&#x200B;

* **Gaza is already free, Israel withdrew settlements from the Gaza Strip, so why are they still shooting rockets? It's just because they hate Jews.**

Israel has [imposed a blockade](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/gaza-blockade-israel.html#:~:text=For%20some%20Gazans%2C%20Saturday%20morning's,large%2Dscale%20response%20from%20Israel) on the Gaza Strip for \~16 years. Not only that, but they continually snipe over the wall and kill [hundreds of people engaged in peaceful protest](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2020-03-06/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/42-knees-in-one-day-israeli-snipers-open-up-about-shooting-gaza-protesters/0000017f-f2da-d497-a1ff-f2dab2520000), they send in drones to [spray Gazan gardens with herbicide](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/israeli-spraying-of-herbicide-near-gaza-harming-palestinian-crops#:~:text=The%20study%20tracked%20the%20drift,metres%20(980ft)%20into%20Gaza), and they forcibly control [freshwater and electricity](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-keeps-blocking-power-water-food-to-gaza-interior-ministry/3037404) resources. The Gaza Strip is incredibly densely packed, full of refugees from all the land that Israel violently claimed in 1948, and they are living in unsustainable squalor and misery thanks to the blockade. Despite that they are incredibly persistent and have a spirit of resilience that has led them to continue, somehow, surviving and resisting all this time.

&#x200B;

* **Free Palestine from Hamas! Hamas is ISIS! Food, not rockets! Hamas steals all the humanitarian aid. Why didn't Hamas invest in infrastructure? It's only because of Hamas that the Palestinians are suffering!**

Look at the West Bank; ~~there's no Hamas there~~, (corrected: Hamas does not *rule* there) and Palestinians are still suffering. It's because of Israel that Palestinians are suffering and it's also because of Israel that Hamas exists in the first place. Netanyahu initially [funded Hamas](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/israel-helped-funnel-qatar-money-to-fund-hamas-netanyahu-palestinian-state-gaza-war-2456157-2023-11-01) and [propped them up against the Palestinian governing bodies](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) because his party decided that Israel would never be safe with a free separate Palestinian state next door, and thus [he had to jeopardize the PA's attempts](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4268794-the-symbiotic-relationship-between-netanyahu-and-hamas/) for a two-state solution by manipulatively boosting an internal Palestinian opposition to their secular and peaceful political influence.

Lastly, Hamas does invest in infrastructure too: one of my most memorable conversations in my life was with a Gazan about 10 years ago who told me that her family was trying to build a house, but it took some time, because they had to smuggle concrete powder through tunnels. [Those infamous tunnels were originally dug to smuggle resources into Gaza. They are literally the infrastructure that allowed Gaza to survive the blockade.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip_smuggling_tunnels)

Every single thing is made more difficult by the Israeli blockade, including infrastructure. Every couple years, there is a bombing campaign against Gaza Strip that destroys buildings and kills children. Every time, the Gazans struggle to rebuild. It's incredibly disingenuous to talk about infrastructure when you consider the context, and how much they actually struggle with infrastructure.

&#x200B;

* **Jewishness is a religion, but it's also a race. And that race is in peril because everyone hates them everywhere, and they need their own country to be safe.**

If you are considering a Jew on the basis of race alone, on the basis of semitic heritage, then many Arabs are also semites, yeah? [They are the descendants of Abrahamic Jews.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/)

It's understandable if an *ideology* such as a religion is somehow so unpalatable to everyone else that this ideology needs to have its own space. Nobody else would probably even want into that space, unless they shared this unpalatable ideology. But, if such a space was established for an ideology, it shouldn't be founded on top of other indigenous peoples with a different ideology who would need to be kicked out. As [Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived peacefully together in Palestine](https://www.972mag.com/before-zionism-the-shared-life-of-jews-and-palestinians/) before the foundation of Israel, a supposed ideological conflict between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism is provably not to an issue.

The issue that Zionists will have you believe is that everyone hates the \*race\* of Jews, not necessarily the religion. And this is not true either. It's ultimately very racist on every side to claim that a race needs its own space because it is so unpalatable to everyone else. No race of human beings needs its own country. Humankind needs to be less racist. That's it.

&#x200B;

* **Israel can't stop because then the terrorists will annihilate all the Jews. Palestinians want the death of all Jews. That's why they elected Hamas. It's in Hamas's charter to kill all the Jews!**

The ""election"" \~16 years ago in Gaza was almost a farce, and the majority of Gazans alive today did not even vote in it, either because they were unable due to age or difficulty at the polls, or because they had not even been born, or for the usual reason people don't vote: no faith in the process.

Hamas's charter is admittedly antisemitic but again, they would not exist without Israel. They have been taught an antisemitic agenda -- not by their own as Zionists would have you believe, but by Israel itself. Israel is the one who equates Judaism with Zionism and uses Zionism to suppress and oppress the Palestinian people.

Why is it any wonder that Hamas also equates Judaism with Zionism? This is actually what the Israelis want. An ad for birthright trips to Israel recently stated ""God doesn't care that you eat bacon. You're still a Jew."" [There are many of these ads that tout Jewishness as a race rather than an ideology, and equate Zionism to Judaism. (And thus antisemitism to anti-Zionism.)](https://jweekly.com/2022/06/06/who-is-paying-for-these-jewbelong-bacon-billboards-in-the-east-bay/)

These people consider Jewishness to be an ethnicity rather than a belief system. AND, they want Jews to be oppressed, all over the world, in order to force them to participate in Zionism in order to feel safe.

But it's important to understand that a Zionist is not even necessarily a Jew. A Jew is someone who follows Judaism. A Zionist is someone who believes in the racist state of Israel. Their God is not the One God, it is the false idol of nationalism. That is what Zionists truly worship and it is echoed in their actions, no matter what they say. And what Zionists don't want you to know is that even in the depths of Gaza, a Jew can be safe. See the next point...

&#x200B;

* **Oh, you're a woman protesting for Palestine? Go wear those clothes in Gaza and see what happens! Oh you're a anti-Zionist Jew? Try to go be a Jew in Gaza! Oh, you're LGBTQ+ and you support a free Palestine? Didn't you know that Hamas throws gay people off rooftops?! Israel is the only bastion of civility and decency in the entire Middle East!**

No matter what someone's religious beliefs may be, that doesn't mean they get to push those beliefs on someone else. Misled and uneducated people may commit crimes against others, and some of those people might be Muslims, but this entire argument just feeds into foolish western Islamophobia that serves to fuel western imperialism.

Because imperialism is one of the forces behind the establishment of Israel, it's understandable that they are pushing Islamophobia. However, Gaza actually is not just made of Muslims. Jews, Muslims, Christians, and secular people were peacefully living in Palestine all together, before the Balfour Declaration which established the state of Israel.

An ancient Greek Orthodox church, the oldest church in Gaza, St Porphyrius, was bombed during this most recent genocidal campaign in 2023. [Built in 1150 AD](https://www.archpaper.com/2023/10/saint-porphyrius-church-built-in-1150-is-destroyed-by-an-israeli-strike-during-ongoing-conflict/), it was believed to be the third oldest church in the world and was kept safe and maintained even through Hamas' rule. Israel is the one who destroyed it. Do Christian women wear hijab? Maybe sometimes.

But even many Muslims do not wear hijab. Look at the well-known female journalists who are documenting the bombardment on the ground right now. Does [Bisan](https://www.tiktok.com/@savechildrenuk/video/7300994812881177888) wear a hijab? No. The argument that women are oppressed in Gaza is patently incorrect.

As for LGBTQ+, I'm not denying that queer people are suppressed across the middle east. What Israelis don't tell you is that it's not as if Israel is so different in this regard. [Gay marriage is illegal in Israe](https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2015-06-30/ty-article/.premium/gay-marriage-unlikely-in-israel/0000017f-ef9d-dc28-a17f-ffbf0b740000)l too. And even if gays are being thrown off roofs by Hamas, why would you support the side that has de-facto created Hamas, and is actively bombing and killing those same queer people? [My heart is broken for these people's stories](https://time.com/6326254/queering-the-map-gaza-lgbt-palestinians/) in the same way it would be broken for the suffering of innocent Christians.

As a Muslim and self-professed fundamentalist (meaning I genuinely have faith in the fundamentals of my Abrahamic faith), I believe hate crimes are wrong, no matter who is targeted. And LGBTQ+ people are among some of the kindest and thoughtful humans I have known. As individuals, the vast majority of them are not so cruel, dumb, and selfish as to demand the slaughter and genocide of an entire people in order to strike some supposed blow for liberalism.

As for Jews, why would a Jew chose to live in Gaza, which is an open air prison, rather than Israel, where they are given top status on the social hierarchy according to race? The answer is that this Jew is a journalist with integrity who wants to see what things are really like on the ground. Dan Cohen, along with Max Blumenthal, has lived in Gaza for several months in a row.  [Here's an interview with Dan Cohen on what it was like to live in Gaza as a Jew.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUxWw0dMkNs)

&#x200B;

* **Doesn't Hamas realize they're harming their own people when they start these fights with Israel?**

Hamas did not *start* the fight. They simply subscribe to the mentality that death is better than oppression. When you oppress a people, you might hope to break them. But Palestinians aren't easily broken. If you consider the Gazans as one body, Hamas is their ugly callus, formed by constant difficult friction with the oppressors. If that friction stops, the callus heals.

The idea that oppressed people should be frightened into silence is an idiotic, weak-minded mentality that feeds into the goals of the oppressor.

&#x200B;

* **Why don't the neighboring Arab countries take in the Palestinians? Palestinians already have a state, it's called Jordan! Look, not even Egypt wants these savage animals.**

This is just a transparent ploy to force the Palestinians off the land that they have tended and inhabited for centuries, in order to ethnically cleanse an ethno-state for Zionists. It was coincidentally also a Nazi argument for attempting to exterminate Jews in Germany, based on the fact that the rest of the [Western countries didn't want to accept a mass exodus of Jewish refugees](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/27/14412082/refugees-history-holocaust).

It is a genocidal argument, made for literally ethnically cleansing the region, in order to make Israel a majority-Jewish-race country. Have the people making this argument considered that maybe the Palestinians don't want to be refugees? They don't want to be kicked off their ancestral homeland that they are indigenous to?

&#x200B;

* **Well, if the bombardment is the wrong tactic, then tell me! What should Israel do? What can they do when people are trying to kill them!? Doesn't Israel have the right to defend itself?**

Ner Kitri is a Jewish Israeli who published an article about the [One Democratic State](https://mondoweiss.net/2023/07/the-transition-from-a-jewish-state-to-true-democracy-will-benefit-all/) solution. Look at history for the answer. What did South Africa do to solve its apartheid problem? [The framing of the post-apartheid South African constitution is a good example for Israel to follow.](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/Framing%20the%20State/Chapter5_Framing.pdf)

Fair integration of all people is the only decent and just choice for Israel to do. Fears that this will result in the eradication of Jews is phobic, racist propaganda that dehumanizes and vilifies people who are resisting injustice and apartheid. White people were not eradicated in South Africa, even though the ANC was classed as a terrorist organization and Nelson Mandela was in prison for ""terrorism"". Nobody will be eradicated in Israel if Israel stops being an apartheid state.

That is purely a fearmongering excuse for people who do not actually want to integrate fairly.

&#x200B;

* **Israel is actually not an apartheid state. We even have Arabs in the Knesset.**

Yes, there are Arabs in the Knesset, but maintaining a [low token %20](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/middleeast/arab-israeli-citizens-cmd-intl/index.html#:~:text=Arab%20citizens%20and%20permanent%20residents,a%20large%20Christian%20Arab%20minority) of your population as a minority doesn't stop Israel from being an apartheid state. Even these privileged [token Arabs are ""in a constant battle for their existence"".](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/arabs-israel-stay-sidelines-raging-democracy-battle-2023-07-26/)  Israel [blatantly refuses to treat Jewish and Arab citizens equally](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/6/5/knesset-disqualifies-bill-seeking-equal-status-for-jews-and-arabs) and fairly. It's obvious to anyone who has seen the occupation in place that Israel is an apartheid state.

The existence of a purposefully-low percentage of Arab Israelis doesn't change the fact that Israel is intentionally an ethno-state with a forced majority of people being the ""Jewish Race"".

17ki4fd,A Plan for Integration,"OK we know all the fighting is now going on, but as time goes on and the perpetrators of Oct 7 are dealth with, there needs to be a plan to move forward with Israel and Palestine. Here is my plan, in my fairytale world it could work, but I'm not so naive as to believe there are much deeper factors at play.

**The Palestinian Integration Program (PIP)**

Welcome, Palestinian brother/sister. This is your formal invitation to join the PIP. Here is a quick rundown of the program.You have been invited to apply for this new program which at the end will integrate you a permanent resident of Israel.

*Step 1.*

We will be performing criminal background checks and vetting you for ties and links to Hamas during your application. You may be made to hug a bunch of Jews to show you won't shoot up the first kibbutz you see.

\*Step 2.\*You will now be invited to move into the Secured Integrated Citizen Kibbutz (SICK). SICK operates like a kibbutz, everything is paid for, everything is shared, you work for the same wage as everyone else. There is no need to worry about food, water, medical aid as it is all there. You may find Jewish, Christian and Muslim friends living side-by-side with you.SICK is highly patrolled and guarded by IDF.  If at anytime there is misconduct or proven ties to Hamas, you will be sent back to Gaza/West Bank and no longer eligible to apply for another year. I know what you're thinking, the IDF in charge?! Won't they kill our kids and torture us all? Well, this is a risk you will need to take. Remember, the IDF can't just kick people out or arrest without reason. They have to justify why a person needs to be removed. There might be an oversight committee setup for this, but no one trusts anyone else in this region, so it's kind of useless really. You'll just have to trust us. Anyway, it's just for a year.

\*Step 3.\*Hooray, you made it to a whole year in SICK! You are now allowed to join Israeli society during this probationary period. You are issued an Israeli identity card and can register vehicles using Israeli number plates, which should make things a \*bit\* easier at checkpoints.

The probationary period lasts 5 years, and you essentially have no restrictions except the following:

* You MUST live in an area that is dictated to you by the government. This is to prevent build-up of enclaves. Don't like your Jewish neighbour? Sick of your Christian neighbour? Tough luck. After 5 years, you can move. In the meantime, make friends!
* Your children MUST attend a secular state school (Mamlachti)
* You agree to be subjected to annual background checks
* You agree to attend monthly integration meetings. These meetings are essentially parties organised by the Israeli government, where all ethnicities and religions come together to talk about the state of Israel, to get to know one another and expand professional networks.

Non-compliance at any stage will send you back to Gaza/West Bank immediately, with a blackout period of 1 year before you can apply again.

*Step 4. Shalom!*

\-----

This is my wishful thinking idea to allow peaceful Palestinians enjoying the rights of Israeli residents, and let the murderers and extremists stay in Gaza/West Bank. Given the number of people and the manpower it takes to run this, it will take a long time before things change, but at least a step in the right direction, I hope?",31/10/23 10:45:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17ki4fd/a_plan_for_integration/,0,1,593,Oct 7,top,all
17z029q,Hamas' Goal is Hostages for Prisoner Exchange?,"A quote I've extracted from [this](https://therealnews.com/did-israels-military-kill-its-own-civilians-on-oct-7) news article. The general gist of it is that Hamas' goal on October 7th was to obtain hostages to use for release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

Max Blumenthal:  ""It’s important to understand that the main goal in this Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad military offensive was to gather as many captives as possible, particularly Israeli soldiers, in order to trigger the prisoner exchange that was witnessed when Gilad Shalit in 2011 was released; The Israeli soldier who was taken in 2006, who was operating a tank outside Gaza, was taken in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including the current prime minister of Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. So this entire Al Aqsa Flood operation is understood against the backdrop of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. So gunmen were sent with detailed maps to population centers and to military bases. In the military bases, they were obviously given instructions to attack and kill Israeli soldiers who were maintaining the siege of Gaza. Much of the Gaza division, which has also been responsible for so many massacres inside Gaza over the years, was wiped out. The Erez Crossing… I don’t know if you’ve been through there, Chris.""

I'd recommend reading the whole article as it talks about witness reports and the history of Israeli soldiers firing on their own men to prevent them from being used as hostages.

17p873z,Why Don't Pro-Palestinian Protesters Condemn Hamas or other Arab Countries,"I understand why Pro-Palestinian protesters would focus their demonstrations on condemning Israel - from drone strikes, settlements building, disputed borders, withholding tax revenue and other reasons. 

Why is there not a somewhat balanced condemnation of Hamas and Arab countries for the following reasons?

\- Since taking over power in 2007, Hamas has invested little in economic development, health care, education, infrastructure versus investing/focusing on terrorist campaigns against Israel

\- Hamas routinely launches rockets from hospitals, schools and other high density public places inciting a response from Israel which it must know will cause of large loss of life in Gaza (one reason I suspect for this is the global sympathy to be gained for the Palestinian cause)

\- Seemingly, part of the reasons Hamas this major attack and took hostages from Israel on Oct 7 was to stop the Saudi-Israeli relationship normalization talks which it must have known would result in a military response from Israel leading to massive loss of life in Gaza. Hamas routinely conducts itself in a way that is indifferent to loss of life when there is an opportunity to gain political power

\- Although Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar condemn Israel themselves, they do little to support Palestinian refugees in terms of (for that matter, any refugees from anywhere) accepting refugees into their countries or offering humanitarian support

I am unclear why pro-Palestinian protesters do not focus on the issues in their own camp (Hamas and PA for that matter) nor on the support Arab countries can offer to refugees and almost entirely focus on condemning Israel",06/11/23 17:37:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17p873z/why_dont_propalestinian_protesters_condemn_hamas/,0,12,266,Oct 7,top,all
17as9a3,"Israel denies targeting Gaza hospital, Palestinian leader Abbas cancels meeting with Biden","The bombing of a hospital in Gaza City has killed hundreds of people and escalated the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.  
  
Both sides blamed the other, but horrific scenes of the wounded ignited street protests in capitals across the region.  
  
Israel’s aerial bombardment campaign over the Gaza Strip is part of what it calls a total siege. This includes cutting off water, food and electricity supplies to a population of two million people. Human rights groups have criticized the siege for breaking humanitarian law.  
  
U.S. President Joe Biden has said he plans to address the humanitarian crisis for Palestinian civilians when he visits Israel and Jordan this week.  
  
Israel’s military operation in Gaza, is in response to a brutal terrorist attack in Israel by Hamas Oct. 7 that killed at least 1,000 people, including Americans. The Israeli government says that Hamas is still holding at least 199 hostages kidnapped from Israel.

At least 17 journalists killed since war began, Committee to Protect Journalists says  
The Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 17 journalists have been killed in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Of the known deaths, the CPJ said 13 were Palestinian, three were Israeli and one was Lebanese.  
  
It said eight journalists have been injured and three have been reported missing or detained.  
  
The nonprofit said it continues to investigate “unconfirmed reports of other journalists being killed, missing, detained, hurt or threatened, and of damage to media offices and journalists’ homes.”  
  
“CPJ emphasizes that journalists are civilians doing important work during times of crisis and must not be targeted by warring parties,” said Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. “Journalists across the region are making great sacrifices to cover this heartbreaking conflict. All parties must take steps to ensure their safety.”

The department raised its travel advisory for Lebanon to level 4, the highest on its rating scale, and warned that the embassy in Beirut has limited capacity to support U.S. citizens there.

18g9bfd,"Genuine question: ""free palestine"" does or does not necessarily equate to supporting Hamas?","I've been doing a lot of research because I'm trying to get the most unbiased unskewed information about what's going on. So naturally I then came to reddit. From my understanding (and I can absolutely be wrong) Hamas fired on Israel on oct. 7 (though this started in the 40’s) and Israel has been unrelenting in firing back, basically decimating the Palestinian people. That's been my understanding. That as well as if we don't step in, it could become a genocide level event in Palestine.  
I often get into debates or arguments with my mother. She’s been saying that this is all Hamas’ fault and that they’re hiding among civilians which is why Israel is aiming towards civilians. That Hamas needs to be taken down because they are a terrorist organization. That it is the people of Palestine’s fault for voting them in in 2007. Now, she also only watches Fox news and Newsmax, which tends to give biased information.   
To that extent, is it worth killing thousands of people in unrelenting war to get to these terrorists? Because that seems to be what’s happening. They’re using this as an excuse to kill many many people. Hamas is generally bad, as those who classify it as a terrorist group would agree that it is not good for them to be in charge. So if I want to support Palestine, and I do, does that mean I automatically support Hamas? Or am I able to differentiate the group from the innocent civilians losing everything in this war.   
If this had been happening in a Christian country, I’m sure the world would be reacting much differently. The United States would be. If this happened to us, corrupt politicians began a brutal war here, politicians I didn’t vote for or want, wouldn’t I want someone to come help me and save me because I’m human? Aren’t the people of Palestine worthy of being seen as humans? Humans in need of help from the world, but people are too busy pointing fingers to remember that on both sides people are dying of decisions they had zero part in.   
I'm just trying to get a better understanding, please be nice. If I could wish for peace for everyone, I would. But the Palestinian people need it so much right now.

18l2x7h,What are your thoughts on USA and the West funding Palestinian terrorism?,"One topic that has received very little attention is the US, Western and International funding of Palestinian terrorism. 

It's no secret that Palestine openly supports the murder of Israelis. The official government policy of the Palestinian Authority is to pay out salaries or pensions to Palestinians who murder or injure any Israelis. 

>The Foundation for the Care of the Families of Martyrs **pays monthly cash stipends to the families of Palestinians killed, injured, or imprisoned while carrying out violence against Israel.**[1] The Prisoners Fund makes disbursements to Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli jails. In 2016, the PA paid out about NIS 1.1 billion (US$303 million) in stipends and other benefits.[2]
>
>Payments to Palestinian prisoners is enshrined in Palestinian law. Under the Amended Palestinian Prisoners Law No. 19 (2004), prisoners who have served a year or more in Israeli prison are entitled upon release to health insurance and tuition-free school, university and professional education. If they become civil servants, the law stipulates that the Palestinian Authority will ""pay his social security and pension fees... for the years he spent in prison.""
>
>The payments were routinized during the [Second Intifada (2000–2005).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada)[6] In 2016, payments were made to 35,000 families, **including the families of suicide bombers**, from a 2016 annual budget of $170 million.[7][6] The stipend is higher than the average Palestinian wage.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund

Over in Gaza, the government has stated repeatedly that its goal is the destruction and eradication of Israel (also referred to as ""the Zionist project"". Palestine Gaza has bombarded Israel with over 30,000 rockets since 2001, started 5 wars with them, and invaded Israel slaughtering over a thousand people on October 7.

Yet Palestine continues to receive billions in dollars in aid from the world every single year - USA, Europe, Japan and Arab nations.

>The entities that provide such >aid are categorized into seven groups: the Arab nations, the European Union, the United States, Japan, international institutions (including agencies of the UN system), European countries, and other nations.[6] The United States has been a major donor, providing more than $5.2 billion through USAID since 1994.[7]

>The international community has sent billions of dollars in aid to the Gaza Strip to provide relief to the more than 2 million Palestinians living there.[8] From 2014 to 2020, U.N. agencies spent nearly $4.5 billion in Gaza, including $600 million in 2020 alone.[8] According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, aid to Palestinians totaled over $40 billion between 1994 and 2020.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_aid_to_Palestinians

In 2022 alone, the US has donated $500 million dollars to Palestine, of which $350 million went to UNRWA and $150 million was donated through USAID. Germany, an ally to Israel, was the second highest donor to Palestine in 2022.

From the 1990s until now, [there have been around a thousand terrorist attacks against innocent Israelis](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/comprehensive-listing-of-terrorism-victims-in-israel)

Now my question is:

- **If you're an American:** How do you expect a 75 year old conflict to end when you're prolonging it by constantly funding both sides? The US funds billions of dollars to Israel to purchase weapons, then funds billions of dollars to Palestine to commit terrorist attacks against Israelis.
- **If you're a German:** How do you feel about funding Palestinian terrorists to continue their genocide against Jews when you acknowledged that the Holocaust was wrong? Germany is the 2nd largest funder of Palestinian terrorism after the US.
- **If you're a citizen of the EU, Japan, or a citizen of a country that donates to Palestine:** How do you feel knowing that billions of dollars of your tax money support and fund Palestinian terrorism which has murdered and killed thousands of innocent families, women and children through street stabbings, car rammings, shootings and suicide bombings?",18/12/23 07:19:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18l2x7h/what_are_your_thoughts_on_usa_and_the_west/,0,112,625,Oct 7,top,all
18bl3n0,Is it the moral obligation for Palestinians to give in to make way for a Zionist homeland?,"Is it the moral obligation for Palestinians to move aside to give way for Zionist to establish a homeland? 

I used to be neutral but now am more Pro-Palestine, simply because they were dealt a terrible injustice that the world seems to be largely unaware of. Or they are vaguely aware. 

The massacre of the village Deir Yassin (who by the way declared neutrality during the war of independence Nov 1947) was Palestines Oct 7. That slaughtering occurred in April 1948. The Arab Israeli War started in May 1948, in part as a response to the massacres, explosions, and driving out of Palestinians by Zionists. Do you see the timeline here?

These are part of the circumstances that created Hammas. Not to mention current discrimination against Palestinians in Israel. But is Hammas to blame for the circumstances before Hammas was created? Is everything the Palestinians fault? Palestinians we're killed or driven out of their land to make way for a Jewish homeland. Yes, there were peace talks and borders drawn and they didn’t take it. I’m sure they regret it today. But again, Is it the moral obligation of Palestinians to just accept living next to their killers and thieves? Would you agree to do that?

That said, I empathize with the Jews plight. They have suffered more than probably any other group in history. Ideally there would be a way for them to have a safe haven country for themselves. The very thought brings solace to me. Safety is a human right. 

But if the way this happens in modern times is by driving out or killing people, that’s deplorable. We’re past that. If we allow everyone who’s got a historical right to the land to come back, then America belongs to the Natives. It doesn’t really work that way. 

So, what can we expect Palestinians to do? To just forget and accept?",05/12/23 20:13:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18bl3n0/is_it_the_moral_obligation_for_palestinians_to/,0,65,314,Oct 7,top,all

- the argument about “human shield” doesn’t Israel have agency to just not bomb the shit out of innocent civilians? Including their own if they are worried about their hostages even if they are also bombing them? What if Hamas was hiding in Israel, would they bomb a shit ton of Israelis to get to Hamas?

- Israel clearly has one of the strongest defense and well funded armies…

There were no casualties or injuries from the explosion. 

If Hamas could blow a hole in the wall and breach into Israel on Oct 7th, surely a big enough explosion could also breach the Egypt-Gaza barricade. Or a random Houthi rocket or one of those misfired Hamas or Islamic Jihad rockets could accidentally blow a hole in the Egypt-Gaza wall. Or an accidental airstrike from IDF. Other actors or myterious unexplained explosion at the Egypt-Gaza wall.

1. What will the people of Gaza do ? Especially those who heard or saw the explosion nearby and already sheltering in Rafah, a border town along the Egypt-Gaza barrier ? There is a nearby Refugee Camp sheltering hundreds of thousands of refugees. Will the people of Gaza try to escape Gaza into Egypt ? Or will they do nothing and stay put in Rafah, Gaza ? 

2. What will Egypt do ? Egypt had repeatedly warn Israel ties could ‘rupture’ if Gaza multitudes flee to Sinai https://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-said-to-warn-israel-ties-could-rupture-if-gaza-multitudes-flee-to-sinai/ and President Sisi has repeatedly said Egypt will not accept Gazan refugees https://www.reuters.com/world/egypt-rejects-any-displacement-palestinians-into-sinai-says-sisi-2023-10-18/ . What will the Egyptian border guards do ? Will they open fire and shoot at the people of Gaza trying to escape and cross into Egypt ? Will Egyptian border guards prevent humanitarian aid going into Gaza via the breach ? 

3. What will Hamas do ? Will Hamas guards open fire at people of Gaza trying to escape ? What if Hamas trying to bring in weapons and reinforcements from Egypt into Gaza ? 

4. What will Israel do ? What if senior Hamas leaderships try to escape to Egypt via the breach ? Or Hamas tries to transport hostages out of Gaza ? How will IDF try to stop them ?  

5. There are hundreds of trucks waiting in the other side of Rafah (in the Egyptian side), trying to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza (food, water, fuel, etc…) Each day 80-100 humanitarian aid trucks cross into Gaza via the Rafah border crossing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBKI3MHPn3Q escorted by armed Hamas personnels. Will these humanitarian organizations try to send it aid, they cant drive the trucks through the breached section of the barricade due to rubbles, but what about just passing out aid packages to the people of Gaza ? 

6. Thousands of people from Gaza with foreign visas still trapped inside Gaza and they have been sheltering in Rafah town, hoping to be on the daily list to be allowed to escape Gaza and cross into Egypt. Fed up of waiting, will these people with foreign visas/ dual citizenships try to get out of Gaza via the breach in the Egypt-Gaza barricade ?

7. Will UN, International agencies, charities welcome any people of Gaza fleeing war as they cross into Egypt ? Will they setup refugee camp and provide humanitarian aid to the Gazan refugees who managed to escape into Egypt ? Surely Amnesty International will not turn back these Gazan refugees, would they ?

177wm5h,No Moral Equivalence,"As many have said on in this sub, that there is no moral equivalency between the actions of Hamas and the state of Israel.  I don't know if that is true, but I think it is certainly true that there are limits, morally, I guess, on what Israel can do to the Palestinians.   So, this post is an exercise in trying to establish the moral equivalence between the level of violence in this conflict by establishing a point system for the violent acts.   This way we can keep moral score.  I am totally open to adjusting the point value for various acts, but you have to make a good argument for this.

**Score keeping starts on Oct 7 with the actions of Hamas!**

The Point System:

The point system baseline is 10-points for intentional targeting and killing of an innocent civilian.   This includes proceeding with action that could be avoided, may be unnecessary, is not in self-defense, with knowledge that the action will result in death.   For example, driving a bull-dozer over a protestor would be 1-point as would entering someone’s home and shooting someone.

1. Intentional killing of a civilian - 10 points per individual
2. Collateral damage resulting in death -  2 points per individual
3. Denying basic services resulting in death due to starvation, disease, or lack of medical care - 1 point per civilian
4. Mutilation or torture - 8 points per individual (includes deaths by internationally prohibited weapons).   If a civilian is killed and tortured it is 18 points.
5. Forced relocation of mass populations (ethnic cleansing) - 1 point per individual
6. Imprisonment without due process or holding someone captive - 0.5 points per individual
7. Prohibiting freedom of movement - 0.5 points per individual
8. Destroying property - US dollar value of property / $1M
9. Denial of basic services such as food, water, sanitation, electricity, fuel  (not resulting in death) - number of people affected / 10,000.   If 10,000 people have basic services cut off and one person dies s a result, that would be 2 points for example
10. Destroying homes - points for property value per item 8 above, plus additional point per 1000 people who are made homelessWe can add more ways to earn points as both sides come up with new ways to hurt each other.Anybody want to try calculating the current moral score?",14/10/23 19:07:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/177wm5h/no_moral_equivalence/,0,24,396,Oct 7,top,all
181jhqi,"Why is removing Hamas the primary (and potentially, only) objective for Israel?","Removing Hamas seems to be a straightforward surface level action item - they are after all the ones who organized and carried out the Oct 7 attack. However, Israel must be aware that if they are successful then either (a) the moment they leave Gaza, Hamas will return or (b) another militant group will overtake Hamas's role. 

There are countless examples of (a) and (b) happening. A great example of (a) is the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Despite 20+ years of occupation by the United States, the Taliban return to power in less than a week once U.S. withdrew. A great example of (b) outside of the middle east are drug cartels - the destruction of one cartel just leads to an opportunity for another. Hamas is only 1 militant group in Gaza but there are many others that could fill their void if they are removed. 

So why the focus on Hamas specifically? Why is there little to no discussion from Israeli leadership on solving the root cause for why organization like Hamas exist in the first place. Have we just accepted the idea that Palestinians will inherently always hate Israel (even given the advancements in Israeli-Palestinian relationships in the West Bank despite increased settlements)?

1. Jews, Christians, and any of the other minorities who wish to stay and become citizens of your new country may do so. They will be allowed their own state-funded education system if they so wish, own businesses and work in any job they wish, buy land and houses, have freedom of movement and the right to organize and run for office. Their holidays should be respected, they should be allowed to visit holy sites and pray, all without harassment or fear for their life. This is the bare minimum that we offer to minorities in the country of Israel and we expect the same. 

Those who want to leave are allowed a transition period of 5 years to sell and relocate. None of this pulled out of their homes by the military stuff anymore.
 
2. The beginning of the new country should be demilitarized, much as Japan and Germany were after WW2 and the money should instead be spent on education and infrastructure. If all goes right the new country would never need a military at all, at least not to defend itself from Israel. Can't make any promises for the rest of the Middle East.

The education system needs to be overhauled and approved by Israel, much like Germany and Japan after WW2, to prevent extremist ideology from being taught to the next generations. You are welcome to adopt the curricula of Arab-Israeli schools that go on to produce a bulk of the country's doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and architects. Seems like something is going right there. Feel free to ask for advice on how to encourage kids to get into STEM fields, we seem to be doing well there too. 

3. There needs to be collaboration across all fields. Pen pals and joined programs for kids and adults.  Want us to stop fearing you? Let us get to know you. (Without betraying us and slaughtering us in the most brutal ways you could think of) 

I propose a 10 year transition period in full collaboration with the international community and Israel. Any (violent or incitement to violence) breach of the agreement and you invite upon you the hellfire Gaza is experiencing now. Carrot and Stick. 

If all this is followed through I see no reason you can't have your own country in 10 years. Sure it's a bit later than you'd hoped but these things take time. In any case, better than your alternative, never, right? Thank you for your understanding, I'm so glad we've come to an agreement.",13/12/23 23:52:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18huzmw/how_to_fix_everything/,0,7,543,Oct 7,top,all
18a9t65,US and Israeli officials react to blockbuster report that Israel knew Hamas was planning attack,"Israeli officials obtained Hamas’s battle plan for the Oct. 7 terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, documents, emails and interviews show. But Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, considering it too difficult for Hamas to carry out.

The approximately 40-page document, which the Israeli authorities code-named “Jericho Wall,” outlined, point by point, exactly the kind of devastating invasion that led to the deaths of about 1,200 people.

The translated document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, did not set a date for the attack, but described a methodical assault designed to overwhelm the fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and storm key military bases, including a division headquarters.

Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision. The document called for a barrage of rockets at the outset of the attack, drones to knock out the security cameras and automated machine guns along the border, and gunmen to pour into Israel en masse in paragliders, on motorcycles and on foot — all of which happened on Oct. 7. - NYT

181bgoq,Why won't the war stop within the 'wider context'?,"The loss of any child's life is a tragedy, Palestinian or Israeli

Most people, Israeli or Palestinian, are just like  you and me and deserve to live in peace and prosperity

Israel military have committed countless atrocities on innocent Palestinian people over the decades

Palestinian resistance fighters have committed countless atrocities on innocent Israelis over the decades

If you hold any other view, you are not aware of the history

For instance, if you are Pro Palestinian, you probably don't know that Palestinian authorities have turned down 7 peace deals, including 48% of the land in 1948 and Bill Clinton's deal in 2007 which offered them the Temple Mount, and so have sustained the conflict in the naïve hope they will reclaim all the land one day. That is not going to happen.

Alternatively, if you are Israeli, you are naïve if you cannot concede that many bad actors in the military and government have either committed crimes or enacted devastating policies in the name of 'national security', going right back to leaving poisoned pellets for goat herders to kill their livestock when first reclaiming the territory in 1948 and up until now with reckless if not deliberate bombardment of civilians based on poor and occasional fabricated intelligence.

The only question which matters now is **""How do we make it stop?""**

Answer: stop killing each other

Next question: Why won't they stop killing each other?

Are you prepared to accept the answer, if it were to test your emotional investment?

I do believe this is the answer why this conflict will not stop within the 'wider context' as Pro Palestinians often cite when referencing Oct 7th:

Does all the evidence of them lying make you doubt the things they have said or pushed for in the past/in the things Israelis learn? 

Do Israelis even believe the evidence that the gov were lying? Or do they really just not care? I've seen those vids of palestinians talking to Israelis on omeagle(?)

17j2nvv,State-sponsored genocide and ethnic cleansing are worse than a terrorist attack,"Premises: All human life is of equal intrinsic unquantifiable value. I decry and bemoan the deaths of 1,400 Israelis who died on Oct 7. Unlike perhaps some others I'll even bemoan the death of the IDF soldiers who died that day by the same principles. All people in the world deserve equally to live and flourish. Innocence or guilt, complicity or not, military target or no, these are moral questions separate from the unnegatable value of all human life.

But by the same token I decry the 8,000 human lives the IDF has now bombed to death in the last 3 weeks. Unlike the terror attack on Oct 7, which has now ended and further Israeli casualties are now unexpected, the ongoing siege, bombardment, and invasion of Gaza have no end in sight—Netanyahu said yesterday it will be a ""long war"". Over 3,000 children have already been bombed to pieces. Gazan hospitals are shutting down due to Israel's ongoing blockade of fuel, aid workers cannot communicate during the nightly blackouts, and now Israel is declaring its intention to bomb hospitals. Many if not all of these actions constitute war crimes according to international human rights organizations. Yet Israel receives nothing more than some harsh whispers from Western leaders, while the US supplies additional weapons and funding to its current medieval-sieging, hospital-bombing regime.

There is therefore a very credible argument that what Israel is now doing amounts to ethnic cleansing or genocide. This, to me, and to many people, constitutes a graver and more ongoing threat to humanity and human rights than a single, unsual, now-concluded terrorist attack on October 7th.

Enough with the hasbara. The world can see through it. October 7th was horrible, but the politics of gruesomeness that hasbara promotes (""women! children! grandmothers!"") wears thin, and eventually tears, once you rush to bomb 5-6 times as many women, children and grandmothers.

To most international observers for the last several decades the only solution to the ongoing cycles of violence is a two-state solution. You can't bomb a trapped population into submission, since fighters will re-emerge, unless you kill them all—which is genocide.",29/10/23 13:12:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17j2nvv/statesponsored_genocide_and_ethnic_cleansing_are/,0,86,354,Oct 7,top,all
18dgpd7,Operation Cast Lead: Pro-israelis what’s your opinion on this attack?,"Operation Cast Lead

On December 27, 2008, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead, a massive, 22-day military assault on the Gaza Strip. The ferocity of the attack was unprecedented in the more than six-decade-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, killing some 1,400 Palestinians, most of them civilians.


Cast Lead proceeded in two phases: a week of intense aerial bombing followed by two weeks of a joint air and land assault and invasion. The surprise attack began at 11:30 a.m. on December 27, 2008, with Israeli F-16 fighter jets, Apache helicopters, and unmanned drones striking more than 100 locations across the tiny, crowded Gaza Strip within a matter of minutes.


FACTS AND FIGURES:

• According to investigations by independent Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations, between 1,385 and 1,419 Palestinians were killed during Cast Lead, a majority of them civilians, including at least 308 minors under the age of 18. More than 5000 more were wounded. Thirteen Israelis were also killed, including 3 civilians. (See below for a more detailed breakdown of casualties)


• According to the UN, 3,540 housing units were completely destroyed, with another 2,870 sustaining severe damage.
More than 20,000 people - many of them already refugees, some two or three times over - were made homeless.


• Attacks on Gaza's electricity infrastructure caused an estimated $10 million in damage, according to the Israeli advocacy group Gisha.
268 private businesses were destroyed, and another 432 damaged, at an estimated cost of more than $139 million, according to an assessment by the Private Sector Coordination Council, a Palestinian economic group. A separate report found that 324 factories and workshops were damaged during the war.


• According to the UN Relief Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides services to Palestinian refugees, the offensive damaged almost 20,000 meters (approx. 12 miles) of water pipes, four water reservoirs, 11 wells, and sewage networks and pumping stations. Israeli shelling also damaged 107 UNRWA installations.


• Eighteen schools, including 8 kindergartens, were destroyed, and at least 262 others damaged. Numerous Palestinian government buildings, including police stations, the headquarters of the Palestinian Legislative Council, and part of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' compound, were also destroyed.


After an investigation of the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza, Human Rights Watch accused the Israeli military of violating the international ban on ""wanton destruction"" found in the Fourth Geneva Convention.

This was a surprise attack led by israel causing much worse carnage that oct 7. But this is swept under the rug, while oct 7 is highlighted. Using the same premise that Hamas carried out a terrorist attack and must be dismantled, Israel should’ve been dismantled 10 times over for its act against humanity and terrorism. But here we are, siding with the apartheid colonial regime.

It recently was released that a large percentage of death and injured in this war was due to friendly fire caused by the IDF hurting each other instead of Hamas. 

A large reason why this war initially was so destructive was that the IDF refused to leave their tanks out of concern of injury. Overall we see military strategy that indicates the IDF doesn't trust in their army abilities and more confident aerial bombings despite the civilian casualties. 

All the tiktok videos released by soldiers making a mockery of their rank and being unprofessional and even hatefull. The discovery that the IDF was in fact in control of the 72 virgins twitter which seems to have been focused in increasing hate toward the palestinian to ensure the population doesn't resent the war.

Oct 7 had a large information failure but also the fact that the military was not in gaza providing security was egregious. In addition to this it seems like the IDF has become a political tool for the Likud government helping and protecting settlers take over the westbank instead of protecting the nation

Haaretz released an article that hospitals were realizing injured including amputees straight to their homes not proving any long term care or follow up. This is going to have a long term effect on israel society 

A few military podcasts one of them being Jocko Have all commented that these military operations seem shoddy and hurting the ability to have the population go against gaza.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-dual-citizens-decide-to-stay/

It seems like the civilians that can leave are choosing to leave no longer feeling protected by their government and military. This feels like some evidence that the israel population lost trust in the military ability to protect them.

Prior to oct 7 the IDF had a world class reputation, a perception of the best of the best and it seems like alot of that shine is gone and lost.

Obviously post Oct 7 and the death and destruction that occurred to argue that israel can not defend itself would be wrong. This Haaretz article did make me realize besides the strategy israel has moved ahead with is wrong  imo. the other issue on hand is that what ever right israel has to defend itself cannot occur with benjamin netanyahu still in office. Any actual right that israel would have in attacking back is now colored with the fact there is a political intention of saving his own skin that is the primary reason why Gazans are being bombed instead of self defense and defending israeli citizens. Israel intention are to stop hamas but benjamin netanyahu intention are to prolong the war to ensure his failures are less apparent. He currently sits in a recent poll with 8 percent acceptance rate, why would he prioritize and end the war until the numbers go up. This here I think is the crux of the matter the palestinian currently dead are not dead for the sake of self defense they are dead because benjamin netanyahu is trying to evade responsibility and save himself. The fact he is in power discredits this current attacks on Gaza and it can't be deemed of serving any altruistic benefits.

18ekyi4,Israel's violation of International law,"It's important to gain a fair understanding of Israel's standing at the UN and why the UN General Secretary António Guterres said that the attacks of Oct.7th ""didn't happen in a vacuum"". Israel's representatives have since called him a ""terror apologist"" and accused him of ""condoning terror"", while calling for his resignation.

However, there have been several instances where actions taken by the State of Israel have been considered breaches of international law. These primarily revolve around issues related to settlements in occupied territories (occupied since the 1967 six day war) and the treatment of these areas:

1. **Israeli Settlements in Occupied Territories**: The United Nations consistently states that Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory violate international law. This includes the UN Security Council Resolution 2334 from 2016, which reaffirmed that Israel's establishment of settlements in Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity and are a flagrant violation under international law. For more detailed information, please refer to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 text, available on the UN website [here](https://www.un.org/webcast/pdfs/SRES2334-2016.pdf).

2. **Forced Evictions and Displacement in East Jerusalem**: UN experts have frequently raised concerns about Israel's policies regarding the displacement of Palestinians in East Jerusalem. These concerns include forced evictions and the demolition of Palestinian homes, which have been described as violations of international law. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) often provides updates and reports on such issues. For detailed and current information, you can refer to the OCHA's official website or their specific reports on East Jerusalem, which can be found [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/).

3. **Annexation and Legal Status of Territories**: The annexation of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights by Israel, and their legal status under international law, have been subjects of significant contention. The UN Security Council has deemed the Jerusalem Law and the Golan Heights Law, which were enacted by Israel to assert control over these areas, as illegal. Moreover, the treatment of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, especially after Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza in 2005, continues to be a complex and disputed issue in international law. You can find more information on this from Wikipedia's article on [International law and Israeli settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law_and_Israeli_settlements).

4. **Demolition of Palestinian Properties**: Instances of Israel's demolition of Palestinian properties, including in areas like the West Bank, have been criticized as unlawful and part of a broader strategy of de facto annexation of these territories. This has been viewed as a consolidation of Israel’s control over these areas, with significant implications for the rights of Palestinians. For more details, see the Al Jazeera article [here](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/9/un-expert-israeli-settlements-amount-to-war-crime).

Israel often disputes these interpretations, citing historical connections, security needs, and other factors. The situation remains a major Hallmark of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.

17i6f1z,It’s all going according to plan…,"Up until Oct 7, the Palestinians had become simply an annoying inconvenience to Israel.  There were occasional security issues, but mostly Israel felt the Palestinians had been neutralized as a threat. The slow and steady encroachment on Palestinian land and system of separation between Jews and Arabs allowed the most zealous Israelis to make progress towards their goal of colonizing Judaea and Samaria and the rest of Israel to go about their lives as if there was no conflict.  Most Israelis and the Israeli government, including the security apparatus, did not spend their time thinking about the Palestinians.

The leadership of Hamas, however, thinks about Israel **every day**.  Their people are trapped with no apparent hope of every realizing a life in which they can pursue the opportunities that most westerners take for granted.   So, the leadership of Hamas spends their time thinking of ways they can change this reality and they think about this day in and day out.

They almost certainly contemplated a range of tactics and strategies— a limited strike, a strike only on military targets, a suicide bombing, hunger strike, non-violent protest.   I am sure they considered many possible ways to change the status quo.

Palestinians in Gaza did stage non-violent protests in 2018 and 2019, marching unarmed to the border fence by the thousands and Israeli soldiers killed almost 200 and wounded more than 30,000 of them and the world did not say much.   Suicide bombings get attention for a day or two and the Israeli military destroys the family home of the suicide bomber and the world moves on.   A rocket attack will be answered with a few days of punishing air strikes usually targeting the buildings in which some leader of Hamas and many other civilians live, and the world moves on.

Hamas has certainly come to realize that they cannot destroy Israel, and that to really hurt Israel, they needed Israelis to hurt themselves.    Hamas settled on a strategy to attack Israel in a way that was as deeply offensive as possible.   They undoubtedly knew that Israel would respond to any large scale attack with overwhelming force.   The calculation by Hamas is that the Israeli reaction to the most grotesque attacks on Israeli civilians imaginable would be to embark on a violent, genocidal rampage exposing the Israeli’s deep racism and hatred towards Muslims and Palestinians.

Hamas knows that the injustice done to their people, as with all injustice of this type, is justified by a fundamentally racist view in which the victims are dehumanized and treated as animals.   The justification for denying Palestinians their fundamental rights, to expel them from their homes, to deny the unification of families, to blockade them from having normalized relations with other countries, from traveling abroad, to deny them control over their own natural resources, to fence them in an open air prison, is all based on the premise that most Palestinians just want to kill Jews, that Arabs and Muslims, as a people, are murderous and violent.

So Hamas chose a path in which they would bring out the worst in the Israeli people and then broadcast the cruelty 24/7 on social media.  This is a strategy that could not have worked 20 years ago, but in the age of Instagram and X, everybody can see the devastation, the result of relentless bombing, the proclamations by Israeli leaders that “Palestinians are animals”, arms and legs sticking out from under the rubble of buildings, bloody children with crushed skulls in emergency rooms, a flattened city of a million people, hundreds of thousands of people living in tents, and this conflict is only just getting started.    The death we have seen in the first weeks of bombardment of Gaza is nothing compared to what’s coming.

Already, you can see the fracture this conflict is creating among liberals in the West.   Western governments are lining up to support Israel, while more liberal movements are calling for “Ceasefire” and a “Free Palestine”.   Pending diplomatic agreements between Israel and Arab nations are now on hold for years.  The governments of Arab nations are anxious as their people see the horrific images of death and destruction in Gaza.   Israel and the United States find themselves at odds with the United Nations and on the opposite side of an argument from Human Rights Watch, and the World Health Organization, and Oxfam, and Doctors Without Borders, and Amnesty International.   Jewish liberals are torn between a desire for revenge and Greta Thunberg, their former champion in the fight to slow climate change.

The world may not sit idly by while Israel slaughters hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in an invasion or because of insufficient food, water, and medicine.  There will be long term consequences for sure, countries will start to recall their ambassadors from Israel, and there is a real possibility of a larger international conflict.  This conflict, if Israel continues their assault on Gaza, will fray western alliances, could topple Arab governments if they are not seen to be trying to help the Palestinians, and may drag the United States into a direct confrontation with Iran.

And, I am sure this is all according to plan.   The selfish strategy of Hamas, born out of their own pain and suffering, is to inflict a kind of horror on the whole world, forcing us to watch this spectacle of inhumanity by inducing within Israelis an unbridled passion for killing Palestinians and to force us to finally respond.   In reality, it probably is the option most likely to change the status quo among the many things they have already tried, and in their desperation they have knowingly put millions of lives at risk.   They probably understood that the possibility of improving the lives of Palestinians with this course of action was remote but still greater than other options they had.   And many probably took comfort in the fact that even if their lives were worse at the end, they may leave Israel with a more permanent, self-inflicted wound.

I cannot imagine how Israel recovers as a people, psychologically, if they wake up one morning a few months from now and realize that they have killed hundreds of thousands of children and perhaps a million people and I hope they stop before they have to confront themselves as the worlds most recent genocidal monsters.",28/10/23 04:58:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17i6f1z/its_all_going_according_to_plan/,0,35,1056,Oct 7,top,all

18m7o96,"""Israel is as bad as Hamas""","Pro-Palestinians love to argue that Israel is worse than Hamas and their Palestinian collaborators because Israel has killed more people in total than they did. While this is of course a completely ridiculous statement, I'd like to provide some data before I debunk it.

\- On Oct 7th, Palestinians broke into Israel and massacred 1,162 people in a day. While I don't personally accept this narrative, let's pretend that 162 were killed by friendly fire to get an even 1,000 (and so that pro-Palestinians can't dismiss my figures as having a pro-Israel bias).

\- Over the following 73 days, approximately 19,453 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza ([according to the UN](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-73) via information received from the Hamas Ministry of Health). That means 266 Palestinians are killed per day on average.

In order to be just as bad (in terms of casualties) as the Palestinians who carried out the Oct 7th massacre Israel will need to kill 3.7 times as many people as it currently does per day. On the other hand, if Israel killed Palestinians at the same rate as the Palestinians did on Oct 7th we would expect approximately 73,000 Palestinian casualties after 73 days.

If Israel has the ability to kill significantly more than 266 people per day (especially when you consider that Palestinians were able to kill almost 4 times as many with only RPGs and AK47s) why are we not seeing similar if not worse casualty rates consider the military might wielded by Israel compared to the Palestinians especially if we accept the narrative that Israel is trying to commit genocide or is indiscriminately bombing Gaza?

The key question however, is what would the Palestinians have done if they had free reign to massacre Israelis for 73 days straight and weren't stopped relatively early on in their assault? Would it not be fair to assume that they would have killed significantly more Israelis during that time than the current number of Palestinians who were killed by Israel?

Just some food for thought for those who make ridiculous moral equivalencies between Israel and the Palestinians.",19/12/23 17:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18m7o96/israel_is_as_bad_as_hamas/,0,291,348,Oct 7,top,all

1. Israel has the right to defend itself. To what end? Extermination of Hamas? Countless of reports have shown that this could take years. And judging how the IDF is going on with it, that would mean tens of thousands of innocents killed.
2. The entire world is in solidarity with Israel. I think every single nation that has stood in solidarity with Israel **including Germany** has officials now saying that Israel's actions are excessive.
3. With every person killed in Gaza, you're simply creating more soldiers for Hamas. **Violence breeds violence.**
4. **Hamas started it.** This is my favorite point. We are suddenly upholding a terrorist organization's actions to a ""democratic nation"" and the ""only democracy in the middle east"". Simply absurd. If you held ALL of Hamas's militants and executed them in a public square I promise you not a single person will shed a tear. You wouldn't find half of that backlash on Israel for the atrocities done in the strip.
5. Gazans elected Hamas. It's their government. YES. The uneducated, poor, and sick populace elected an terrorist group in 2006. Definitely a fair elections that can be easily reversed. I'm pretty sure some other candidate can go in the ballot now and win the votes. Those arguments are simply absurd.
6. Israel left the strip years ago. Again, physically? Yes. But you still control how many **calories** go in and out of the strip. You control water, electricity, and passage. Obviously Egyptian borders aren't any lenient nowadays. Another prime example is the **west bank**. How many people were killed in the West bank even before 9/11?
7. Israel is **NOT** an apartheid state.  Yea? well. What about this? [https://www.npr.org/2019/03/11/702264118/netanyahu-says-israel-is-nation-state-of-the-jewish-people-and-them-alone](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/11/702264118/netanyahu-says-israel-is-nation-state-of-the-jewish-people-and-them-alone)
8. \^ Israel has always and always will be a nation that prefers Jews over any other ethnicity. Like you'd have to be living under a rock to just deny that. Another example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boE53Z\_lAg&ab\_channel=Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boE53Z_lAg&ab_channel=Vox)
9. You haven't seen that Hamas did. They murdered and raped babies. To be honest, I haven't seen a single proof showing that Hamas 1) murdered babies (this was refuted by Israel btw) 2) raped women. That said, **IF** that did happen, again, **Hamas is a TERRORIST group.** That's like acting surprised that ISIS killed Egyptian copts. But the consequences shouldn't be lashing out on an entire populace.

My final notes, I do mourn the deaths of any Israeli citizen that died on Oct 7th. No innocent civilian should be murdered regardless of anything. But, that does NOT justify **4 damn months** of bombardment on Gaza.",09/02/24 23:24:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1an1ts0/how_do_you_thing_this_war_is_still_justified/,0,324,438,Oct 7,top,all
17gkhru,"If a country dont have military, who ever protests against the oppressor can be labelled terrorists?","This is in context with the current Israel-Palestene war. One thing that I need to clear straight. I am not for or against Hamas/IDF. On Oct 7, what Hamas has done is disgusting and condemnable. The same true for IDF. After Oct 7, last 2 weeks what IDF doing is disgusting and condemnable. Both are terror according to definitions of terror.

But I hear many people saying, Hamas is a terrorist organisation and IDF is a military of a state. Giving this argument, these people supports IDF and its doing. My question to them is, If there is a country or group of people who don't have military, who ever protests against the oppressor can be labelled terrorists? Let's say, IDF eradicated Hamas after killing many many civilian people. Do anybody think it will be end of dis order and peace will be there? No.

If not Hamas, tomorrow another group will be formed. The root cause is oppression. If Israel stops aggression, normalcy will eventually happen.

18giodi,"The dirty, worst kept secret in this conflict: Palestinians are not viewed as equals by Israelis.","At the root of the intractability of this conflict, is the none-too-subtle belief that Israeli lives are inherently more valuable that Palestinian lives, and this belief is ubiquitously manifested in every facet of this conflict.

For example, on Oct 7th, the world rightly expressed horror at the slaughter of innocent civilians. And they were right to. When children are murdered, revulsion is the only correct reaction.

Barely a month later, twice the number of Palestinian children as the entire number of Oct 7 fatalities were registered. And the world's reaction was ""Israel has the right to defend itself"" - from children?! Where was Israeli, or American, or British revulsion as Palestinian babies murdered (yes, murdered) and left to decompose in incubators?

It doesn't matter how many times or different ways it has to be said that Israel's right to exist is not in question. Israel never fails to remind the world that Hamas' charter advocates the destruction of Israel. But nobody reminds Israelis that Likud's charter is the precise mirror of Hamas' charter! Somehow, the world is expected to be disgusted by Hamas expressed genocidal intent, but not by Likud's! Why??

The world is directed to the isolated and, yes, horrific incidents of Hamas actions, but encouraged to ignore the daily terror suffered by Palestinians for decades, as if the former is intolerable, but the latter is a lesser evil that somehow the Palestinians deserve because they refused to accept inequitable deals that would have permanently entrenched their humiliation and disenfranchisement.

There is not, and has not been for decades, any question that Israel has a cast iron right to exist. So anyone who raises this as an issue is arguing a point nobody but Hamas are making, and they are forgetting that Likud also want a ""river to sea"" future that is devoid of Palestine! So why is the one question, but not the obvious other i.e. why is the right of Palestine to exist perpetually questioned and actively threatened by their continued occupation?

Those of us of a certain age who remember how vile South Africa's apartheid era was, cannot believe how brazenly and how much worse Israeli Apartheid inflicted on Palestinians is today.

It serves nobody to ignore well founded Israeli fears regarding terrorism. And it does not serve them to ignore the most obvious source of the rage that fuels ant Israeli terrorism - their occupation of Palestine.

Until Israel recognize that Palestinians are their equals, and not inferior beings whose lives are disposable. there will never be sustainable peace. And without equitable, sustainable  peace and mutual respect of both people's faiths, fears, hopes, aspirations, and humanity, NEITHER of these people will ever live in security and peace.

1b3x0cr,"The Bizarre twisting of ""From the River to the Sea""","Just a small talking point within the much larger issue. As we all surely know, there is a popular phrase used by pro-palestinian activists that goes: ""from the river to the Sea, Palestine will be free"". 

Now I was aware of the use of this term long before Oct 7, but since then I've witnessed a deliberate effort by anti-palestinian people to attack and warp this phrase into a call for genocide. 

To ignore the Ouroboros of ""they started it"" style arguments within this conflict, let's look at the phrase itself and ask why some are so desperate to see it as a genocidal slogan. 

""From the River to the Sea."" Refers to the space between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean sea. A space which is currently the location of Israel and the Palestinian territories. Although for the sake of nuance, we should also mention that a large portion of southern Israel/West Bank doesn't border the Jordan. The space described in the phrase doesn't include all of Israel and arguably none of Gaza. 

Although this is just semantics. The way the phrase is understood and used is intended to describe all of Israel+Palestine. 

Then there's ""Palestine will be free"", which I think is the bigger source of mixed interpretation. On the surface it is simple. Palestine will be free. Since Palestine has never been a sovereign country though, this brings up questions of what version of Palestine. Mandatory Palestine? Un partition? Gaza+WB? The slogan can't possibly answer this and still be a slogan so it leaves space for interpretation.

Pro-pals view it as a call for the emancipation of the Palestinian people, and to be honest this is the meaning I agree with. Currently Palestinians are not free. They do not have a right to self determination. They do not have a right of return. They do not have a right to self-defense.They do not have free movement even within some of their own territory, which has been slowly eroded by encroaching Israeli settlements. They face many restrictions upon their daily lives such as checkpoints, needing Israeli clearance for building infrastructure, trade restrictions, and blockades (the most egregious of which cuts off their access to large swathes of prime fishing/commerce water). By no definition of the word can Palestinians in this region be called free. Palestinian citizens of Israel have legal freedom, but the foundation for that is shaky at best for reasons I won't get into.

And this is why I say I agree with this statement. If a group of people are not free, I wish to see them freed.   Simple as. And as a black person, our recent history is marred by subjugation and enslavement, meaning I have a particular distaste for one group subjugating  another. 

So I'm very confused as to how a clear call for freedom for a clearly not free people is being characterized as a call for genocide. 

This claim inherently requires the belief that Palestinian freedom necessitates Jewish/Israeli genocide/ethnic cleansing. I gather that those opposed to the phrase view the conflict exclusively as Palestinians acting violently and offensively while Israelis act exclusively defensively. The IDF is called the Israeli ""defense"" force after all. So it seems that to them Palestinians are inherently violent people who won't consider themselves free unless they're dancing in Jewish blood. I can understand how decades of conflict and death can make someone see the world this way, but I don't think it's logical or reasonable. 

Ironically the Israeli rebuttal of ""from the river to the Sea, Israel is all you'll see"" is inherently more genocidal in nature. It actively promises the annexation of the Palestinian territories into Israel, which in the vast majority of scenarios would require a genocide/ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. This isn't even a BLM/ALM situation where both phrases are initially reasonable with layers of subtext. This is just blatantly a call for freedom vs a call for erasure. 

I can already assume the thoughts of pro-palestinian people on this topic, so I especially want to hear from the anti-palestine side. None of this ""Khamas"" stuff. When speaking specifically about the wording, context and use of this phrase, what about it makes you see it as genocidal, why does that overpower it's emancipatory use, and how is the Israeli rebuttal phrase not explicitly worse?",01/03/24 15:29:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1b3x0cr/the_bizarre_twisting_of_from_the_river_to_the_sea/,0,370,720,Oct 7,top,all

One cannot go from having no clue whats going on to knowing everything about an insurgent force. So either:

A. They did not see the attack coming, have no intelligence and are just blindly dropping bombs on targets or god forbid targeting civilians.

179nss5,Reddit no more,"Last post on Reddit. Clearly, it has been taken over by Israel bots and apologists. 

Hamas is a terrorist organization. It committed murder and  kidnapped Oct 7. But Israel, especially the fanatical right wing and rabid extremist settlers, are not faultless in the attack. They bear responsibilty for the violence and humiliation they have bestowed on Palestinians, especially in recent years. It just doesn't get much media air time.

Israel is a terrorist nation that can do no wrong in the eyes of western media and groveling politicians.  It is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity as it has done since its creation.  The next generation of Jews will be judged harshly for the cruel, revenge driven crimes committed by Israel. 

Google Ariel Sharon 1982 and read for yourself about the war crimes and crimes against humanity that got a pass from the west. The double standard is immoral and revolting.  Way before Hamas ever existed.

18zsg7r,Misconception 1: Gaza Health Ministry is Unreliable,"I think I'll make a series of posts about some common misconceptions in this subreddit that are easily refutable. This is an important series of posts to make because we should not need to spend 3 reply chains getting to common ground on what we're discussing. We'll see how this one goes.  
The first is that, because the Gaza Health Ministry is run by Hamas, that it inflates numbers so its casualty numbers are fake. This has been often used to deny the magnitude of suffering inflicted during the IDF's invasion of Gaza. Regardless of where you stand, this is an important point because all conversations need to start from an agreement on what is happening on the ground level. The death toll is a large part of that reality.

Some Israeli officials point to the inability to separate the causes of death and its operation an an institution endogenous to Gaza as issues.  
However, any search from non-biased sources shows that Hamas exerts pressure on it, but it's still under the control of Fatah. Also, the UN, WHO, Red Cross, and Red Crescent trust its numbers. This is because their methodology is quite rigorous. Moreover, GHM and Israeli post-war casualty numbers have historically been very close. Disagreements are typically in the tens for counts numbering in the thousands. This is negligible when you consider the difficulty of counting body parts.

17wgefb,Israel is losing the information war,"Israel is losing the information war. Older people who still get their news from mainstream media/cable news (cnn, fox etc.) are more likely to be pro-israel since the mainstream media is biased and pushes Israel propoganda. However, the younger generation which has access to social media and other news outlets are much less likely to be pro-israel. Pro-israel people blame TikTok, but the reality is, TikTok algorithm only pushes stuff you are interested in. More people are pro-Palestinian amongst the younger generation.

 And of course world wide, israel isn’t popular. All the Muslims (2 billion) of course support Palestine by default. But a lot of African and South American countries seem to also be pro-Palestinian as well as many European countries. The main backer of Israel seems to be US and UK. Even France has become hesitant after seeing what Israel has done in Gaza.

Lastly, anyone who has brain and doesn’t believe in the IDF lies, knows their intention is ethnic cleansing. The lies (beheaded babies, rape etc) are all used to justify genocide. Israel lied about 1500 ppl killed. And btw a lot of those were idf soldiers. The music people were caught in between fire from hamas and idf. Does anyone really believe hamas has machines to completely burn cars? The people who believe this are the same ones who believed Iraq had WMDs. Hamas has a better record historically then IDF when it comes to lies (Look up the record instead of crying). A lot of their leaders have practically called for a genocide. Bibi quoted amalek from the Bible where their god commands the Israelites to kill men, women and children. Now imagine if Hamas said that? 

Israel uses the same talking points about “human shields” and “right to defend”, but I think everyone is awake now. Hamas killed less civilians intentionally then IDF. Hamas main goal is a hostage swap. Why don’t the pro_israelis call for a release of Palestinian children hostages and women who are raped by the IDF? Even oct 7 attack about half were soldiers. Israel has killed over 90% civilians. They are targeting civilians not hamas. 40k residential building destroyed. Hamas is underground so what’s the point? Btw Gaza is 25 miles so no matter where hamas operates there will be civilians. So the human shield argument is dumb. Imagine if there was a school shooter and to get him you bomb the whole school. They want to make sure gazans have nothing to come back to. Btw u can’t defeat an ideology. They know that. These people will rightfully hate Israel. That’s why they want to push them into Egypt. Why is IDF and settler terrorism in the West Bank allowed? Can’t blame hamas. Palestinian have protested peacefully and IDF has constantly killed unarmed civilians. Why isn’t that terrorism? Why don’t Palestinians have a right to defend? Why is that terrorism?

18aauag,Did I get the gist correct?,"As someone who made a brief research of the conflict, here is what I THINK I understand:

-Palestinians occupied (not owned) the land first 
-Jews were persecuted and scattered, some took refuge in Palestine 
-Zionism was established, Jews started wanting to take over the land of Palestine 
-the Jews succeed, Palestine is then renamed to Israel 
-Palestinians are xenophobic towards Israelis, while Israel confined Palestinians in Gaza (aka the world’s largest air prison) 
-Oct 7 happened, allegations of war crimes surfaced regarding Hamas but there is no proof of that 
-Proofs of IDF committing war crimes are everywhere (they bombed civilians)
-Hamas just broke the ceasefire very recently

My questions are:

-Are the attacks on Israel justified? Since they apparently coveted a land that didn’t belong to them
-Which side does the land actually belong
to?
-Is Israel really defending themselves against Hamas? What they have been doing seems like abit of an overkill

18yraao,Anti-Zionism = anti-Semitism (because intolerance of Jews is the origin of the debate),"Tl;dr: I think Anti-Zionism = anti-Semitism because there wouldn't be any debate if there was no anti-Semitism. Hatred toward Jews has always been the origin and essence of anti-Zionism.  

Can anyone help me find the flaws in my reasoning and/or whatever thoughts you have about this?  

If someone wanted the U.S. to be abolished, I'd say that's anti-American. 

And if someone was opposed to the existence of Pakistan as a place for Muslims and there was no other Muslim nation on the planet, that would seem anti-Muslim.  

* Anti-Zionism = bigotry toward Jews, because there would be no debate about ""Zionism"" if there was no intolerance of Jews in the region. 
* Intolerance of Jews immigrating to the region was the reason for the conflict in 1936.
* Jews have coexisted peacefully with Muslims/Christians/others and could have done so while establishing their state in 1948.  
* Egypt and Israel did not implement the blockade in 2007 just to be mean.  It was a response to the election of a terrorist group running on a platform of ""We will obliterate Israel.""  
* All criticism of the blockade has been shown to be meritless by the fact that it was proven necessary and justified by the Oct 7 attack and the $300 million worth of underground tunnels they made with the stuff that was allowed into the region. (i.e. everyone who says the blockade was unjustified needs to stfu now). 
* People who argue that the anger toward Israel results from the blockade are just being ridiculous because the Quran and Hadiths literally teach enmity toward Jews, and killing Jews on Judgment Day. etc. It's just zany to try to pretend it began with the blockade.  

Anti-Zionism = bigotry toward Jews in the same way opposing the refuge for a nonwhite person being chased by a lynch mob of klansmen would be bigotry toward that person.   

If someone says Israel should not exist because its existence displaced indigenous people, someone should remind them: 1.) Jews are also indigenous to the region, and 2.) there simply would be no conflict about Zionism had it not been for the fact that the majority of people in the region were intolerant of one little group. 

I hope I'm explaining this in a way that makes sense.  To me it's like.. kind of freaking me out that anyone doesn't see it this way.    ",04/01/24 23:21:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18yraao/antizionism_antisemitism_because_intolerance_of/,0,376,397,Oct 7,top,all

1ajmv8b,Important points and questions,"1- Killing of civilians is never a good thing, important points to consider however include the following  
\- do retired army men count as civilians?  
\- do ""civilians"" owning active guns count as civilians if they shoot at militants? do they become valid targets if they engage in combat?  
  
2- What happened on Oct 7 is a sad consequence of the occupation of Palestine.  
\- its not fair to completely accept the israeli narrative without taking Hamas' narrative into consideration (that it was a group of gaza millitants/ or israeli self-fire unassociated with Hamas that committed the civllian massacres)  
\- it is therefore super important to verify both claims to figure out how to proceed

\- Important note: Israel could be saying the truth, they are not doing enough to prove their narrative though. I know it is a frustrating take, especially if you hold israel very close to your heart, but it is the truth, we need closure on this via independent third party investigations

3- hostage taking is bad, would love to hear other ideas though about how hamas could've liberated Palestinian hostages (a huge portion of which are labelled incorrectly as prisoners)  
  
4- Israel plausibly committing genocide is a big red flag! nations need to be more careful about how they are approaching this. Again I understand that some people associate their identity, be it evangelical Christians or Zionist Jews, with Israel, but you need to accept that the ICJ ruled for the plausibility of the genocide charges! Re-assess your moral stances   
  
5- Anti-semitism is horrible! no one supporting palestine should support it. If they do, then they are misguided.   
  
6- Zionism is a divisive idea that puts the needs of one population (Jews) above those of another.   
   
7- for the two populations to live in peace, i believe an arrangement similar to bosnia or lebanon is necessary. The whole idea of ""Jewish nature"" of the state needs to be dismantled otherwise it will always put the needs of Palestinians on a lower priority.  
  
8- Please be respectful, I know people are very polarized now, and that's sad. I wish the general sentiment was one of pushing for justice and equality.  
  
9- I openly support Palestine, but it's important to understand the complexity of my stance. To prevent any misinterpretation, supporting Palestine does not equate to anti-Semitism, nor does it involve displacing Jewish individuals from what was historically Mandatory Palestine, or denying Jews a safe homeland. My advocacy for Palestine envisions a place where diverse religious communities coexist peacefully and securely. I envision a society where Palestinian and Jewish cultures are both celebrated, fostering a diverse and vibrant community. This includes marriages across cultures, the free exchange of ideas, and respect for both halal and kosher dietary laws. I support a Palestine that welcomes back refugees, ensures safety for Jewish people, and holds war criminals accountable.  


10- currently, Palestinians, in the west bank (including my family) and more so in Gaza, are facing horrible dehumanizing conditions, That is absolutely unacceptable and needs to be immediately stopped  
  
I know this will anger a lot, I've been arguing on this subreddit for so long now, I know what arguments to expect. I genuinely do not want to engage in any unnecessary back and forth about technicalities or word play. Please argue in good faith, and if you do not have family dying right now in a place that you cannot visit, then remember that you have no right to judge me for my stance.",05/02/24 17:58:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ajmv8b/important_points_and_questions/,0,115,585,Oct 7,top,all

we see that israel has proven again and again as recently as yesterday that they are willing to kill their own even when naked and waving white flag and with the story of the helicopters firing at Hamas Terrorists , how many of those 695 were killed by IDF themselves. 

&#x200B;

We have to wonder with this hyper inflated figures and lack of regard for even Israeli life, how many Palestinians have the IDF killed while they surrendered. how many children and women were killed in this manner .

18ilfcp,Pro-Palestinian Arguments,"This was originally a comment I made on someone's post, but I think it will have more reach as a post. Please be respectful and I will maintain an openness to argue and discuss.

Most pro-palestine supporters I'd argue (as a palestinian from the west bank who studies in the US) have the following positions:

1- Israel is guilty of far more, and far more heinous crimes than what is being attributed to Hamas. in the 75 years of occupation, Palestinians, including myself and my family have been regularly harassed for nothing - simply to dull the morale of the Palestinian cause 

2- Rape and the Murder of civilians on Oct 7 and otherwise is completely unacceptable. That being said, as of now, it is very unclear what happened that day, and who the perpetrators were. Israel obviously claims it was the Hamas militants who performed these atrocities but Hamas rejects these claims. Believing one vs another is all just make-believe. We need a proper investigations with proper evidence by third parties to accurately assess what happened. It is obvious Israel is avoiding that and thus it arouses so many suspicions about what actually happened

3- In terms of genocidal rhetoric, Israelis have their fair share of really outrageous claims constantly being documented. While I agree that on occasion you do hear antisemitic rhetoric from Palestinians. As a progressive Palestinian myself, I attest that this isn't necessarily always meant to be antisemitic. What happens most of the time is a confusion of terms where Palestinians refer to zionists as Jews in their statements. I and a bunch of others are constantly fighting this and trying to highlight the difference between Judaism and Zionism, and most Palestinians, heck even Hamas leadership(video evidence exists and I'm happy to share), are receptive to that distinction because ultimately it really doesn't matter where the colonials are from or what they believe in. Even if Israel had been a Muslim Arab state, Palestinians would still antagonize it.

4- in terms of labelling Hamas as terrorists, there are a few points to be made. Firstly, the US, EU, and Japan don't have the moral high ground necessary to decide what constitutes a terrorist entity. US invasion of Iraq and Vietnam, Pearl harbor, EU's World wars, Japanese invasion of Korea are all actions of a terrorist caliber that have not been labelled as such. This renders the US, EU, and Japan's claim that Hamas is terrorist practically meaningless. Why has Russia not been labelled as a terrorist entity after it's invasion of Ukraine? what is this arbitrary morality system. Secondly, Israel is by far much more lethal, and has caused way more damage to Palestinians than Hamas ever did to Israelis. Funnily enough, at no point in history was Hamas' damage to Israel even comparable to the damage Israel inflicted on Palestinians. The ""terrorist"" label is arbitrary and only serves to alienate and justify war crimes. 

5- No peaceful solution is possible unless a full arms-embargo is enforced on all warring parties, be it Hamas or Israel. Only then can true diplomacy happen.",14/12/23 23:06:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18ilfcp/propalestinian_arguments/,0,200,516,Oct 7,top,all
18wokmc,Israeli journalist Haviv Rettig Gur explaining why Israel’s PR is so bad globally,"Haviv Rettig Gur (Israeli journalist for Times of Israel) left-leaning. Nethanyahu’s government is right /far-right leaning. It’s painfully frustrating and difficult to listen to any Israeli government officials for someone from the left or centre, more so for people from the international community, outside of Israel. I think Israel’s right-leaning Prime Minister and other far-right ministers are mostly pandering to their right wing supporters. The only person I can listen to from this right-leaning government is Eylon Levy, the official spokesman of the Prime Minister’s Office. He just hits the right tone, able to articulate himself properly, political correctness and not too extreme. 

https://youtu.be/HgBEFdtyopQ?t=2003 (Nov 1st, 2023, UC Berkeley School of Law).

1. The most important thing to know about Israelis, the deepest ethos that define us as a culture is “not caring what other people think”. 

2. The disapora condition of a Jew, is the minority condition, in which you are constantly aware what people think of you. In a place like America, Jews have been accepted profoundly as Americans, hence a lot less so. But in countries like Russia and the rest of the world outside the English speaking world, Jews are always aware of themselves as a minority and always aware of what everyone thinks about them. 

3. From 1881 Auto-Emacipation by Leo Pinsker, one of the essential lessons of the Zionist movement that it inculcated and taught in schools and wrote its history of the Jews according to this ethos, is you don’t justify yourself. You don’t explain yourself. You don’t ask for permission to exist because the non-Jew wants you to ask for permission to exist and for you to live there. When you live under Imperial Russia, that is absolutely correct. That was the experience. People who talked about whether Israel has a right to exist. What Zionism taught us was that the non-Jew thinks he has the right to decide whether I have the right to exist. And I should say to him, go f*&# yourself.

4. The state of Israel keeps establishing public diplomacy ministries, and then keeps closing them down. That PR ministry has been established five times. Nobody knows what to do with it. Israelis are terrible at telling their story, because it feels like justification. And to be Israeli is not justify yourself to the world. 

5. Everytime the world comes around and say the international community, the UN, public opinion, anywhere on Earth, including the United States who Israelis do care about, turns against Israel, the automatic Israeli answer is, I am not going to justify my existence. If they don’t understand, they don’t understand. And that’s their problem. What’s important isn’t what they think, it’s what I do. This is a deep impulse of Israeli culture.

Get foreigners to do the PR for Israel or people not deeply affected by the ethos. A notable example is Douglas Murray, he went to Israel after Oct 7th, he understands the English speaking audience. He says the right things/words. He appears on TV debates/interviews/talk show etc…, speaking on behalf of Israel, defending Israel. Others I can think of that are good PR for Israel are Mosab Yousef, (son of co-founder of Hamas speaking out against Hamas) https://youtu.be/pjOEJumoABg and Yoseph Haddad (An Arab Israeli Christian pro-Israel activist)

Similarly, Hamas dont talk too often. When Hamas does speak, they often make mistakes/ faux pas at least from the point of an English speaking audience. Ahha gotcha…It’s better for Hamas not to speak, let others speak for them, there are many, they know better which buttons to push to get the English speaking audience to support and sympathize with Gaza.",02/01/24 12:43:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18wokmc/israeli_journalist_haviv_rettig_gur_explaining/,120,336,607,Oct 2023,top,all

As they noted, it's a negotiation tactic to try and retrieve the hostages. Hamas, the elected government of Gaza, is holding men women and children hostage and has worked to build a massive tunnel system and wage war rather than using the aid they get to seek out financial independence from Israel.

Just so people know. Hopefully Hamas will stop being evil and return the hostages, or the Gazans will realize the evil nature of their government and overthrow Hamas.

1bj7xw0,"Israel can't be an apartheid state, because of Israeli Arabs","I will not be making the case here that Israel is an apartheid society or that it has committed crimes of apartheid. Plenty of Human Rights organisations have already made a better case than I will ever be able to, if their in-depth research doesn't convince you, then nothing will. You can read their reports here :

- 1 February 2022 [Amnesty International report](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/) Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians

Rather, I wanted to refute an argument that I often hear from Zionists : “Israel can’t be an apartheid State”, they say, because “20% of Israelis are Israeli Arabs, they have equal rights according to the law, they have representation in parliament and even a supreme court justice”. Is this evidence that Israel is not an apartheid state or that Israel has not committed crimes of apartheid? Absolutely not, and I will address all of these claims in this post.

&nbsp;

- **What is apartheid**

First off, it’s important that we agree on what is meant by “apartheid”. If by Apartheid we mean enacting the exact same laws and policies that were in effect in Apartheid South Africa, then of course no other state will ever fit this definition, because no two states will ever implement the exact same policies.  

A much more useful definition is the UN definition of the crime of Apartheid, as defined in article II of the [1976 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.10_International%20Convention%20on%20the%20Suppression%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Apartheid.pdf). The definition is a page-long, I encourage you to read it yourself, but in its essence, the crime of apartheid is defined as “**inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them**”.

Another useful defintion is the [1998 Statute of Rome](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf) definition, which defines crimes of apartheid as :  **inhumane acts of a character similar to those referred to in paragraph 1, committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime**.

It should be noted that neither the UN definition nor the status of Rome definition define what a 'racial group' group is, an issue which has been criticized by groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.  They argue that the category 'racial group' should be broadly defined in a similar way to the [1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/cerd.pdf), which defines 'racial discrimination' as '**any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life**'.

Now that this is out of the way, let’s see if the arguments of Zionists about Israeli Arabs disprove that this definition applies to Israel.

&nbsp;

- **Argument : 20% of the population of Israel is “Israeli Arab” and enjoys equal rights according to the law**

Today, 2 million people, about 20% of Israeli citizens are indeed “Israeli Arabs”. The name “Israeli Arab” itself is contentious, since this appellation was [born out of an effort by Israel](https://books.google.be/books?id=Qcnz7SCkyAMC&q=israeli+arab+israeli-arab+hyphen&pg=PA43&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=israeli%20arab%20israeli-arab%20hyphen&f=false) to distance Palestinians with Israeli citizenship from those without who live in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza or refugee camps in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. I will therefore refer to them as Palestinians with Israeli citizenship.

Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are for the overwhelming majority the descendants of the Palestinians who stayed within the borders of Israel after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The state of Israel was created out of the British Mandate of Palestine, then home to about 1.2 million Palestinians. After more than 700,000 of them were ethnically cleansed in the Nakba, about 150.000 remained within the portion of mandatory Palestine that would become the state of Israel, and they were granted Israeli citizenship.

Zionists often say that they have “equal rights” but usually never say according to what. The document that is used to prove that Palestinians with Israeli citizenship have equal rights is the 1948 [declaration of Independence of Israel](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/israel.asp) :

>We appeal to the Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the State on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions.

So it is true then that they have equal rights? Not so fast : just because this document calls for equal rights for Palestinians doesn’t mean it was the case in practice.  For the first 18 years of existence of Israel, Palestinians with Israeli citizenship were under martial law, while Jews were not, so from the start they were clearly not “equal citizens”. Also, if we compare it to the 1776 [Declaration of Independence of the United States](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript) :

>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

I don’t have to remind you that while this document calls for equal rights for all, at the same time, the US government was stealing lands, killing Native Americans, and enslaving Africans. Besides, the two Declarations of Independence are political documents, not legal ones.

Indeed, **the Declaration of Independence of Israel has no legal value** : the Knesset maintains that the declaration is neither a law nor an ordinary legal document. The first President of the Supreme Court of Justice of Israel, Moshe Smoira, [put this as follows](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/analysis-of-israel-s-declaration-of-establishment):

> The Declaration expresses the vision and credo of the people, **but it is not a constitutional law** making a practical ruling on the upholding or nullification of various ordinances and statutes.

In Israel, legal rights are enshrined in a set of “[Basic Laws](https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/activity/pages/basiclaws.aspx)” that form its constitution. Do Palestinians with Israeli citizenship have equal rights according to the Basic Laws, then? No, nowhere are their rights to equality [mentioned in the Basic Laws](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/33327). You could say that is part of [the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty](https://main.knesset.gov.il/EN/activity/documents/BasicLawsPDF/BasicLawLiberty.pdf), but it does not enumerate a right to equality; on the contrary, this Basic Law [emphasizes the character of the state as a Jewish state](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf).

Not only is equality not enshrined in the Constitution, it is in fact the opposite, since the 2018 [Basic Law - Israel as a Nation-State of the Jewish people](https://main.knesset.gov.il/EN/activity/documents/BasicLawsPDF/BasicLawNationState.pdf) was passed, Jewish supremacy is enshrined in the constitution. The law says :

- The Land of Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish People, in which the State of Israel was established.
- The State of Israel is the nation state of the Jewish People in which it realizes its natural, cultural, religious and historical right to self-determination.
- The realization of the right to national self-determination in the State of Israel is exclusive to the Jewish People.

Other laws in Israel also guarantee Jewish Supremacy. The [1950 Law of Return](https://archive.jewishagency.org/first-steps/program/5131/), for example, grants all Jews, as well as their children, grandchildren, and spouses, the right to move to Israel and automatically gain citizenship. In practice, this means : 

- Someone like [Jaakob Fauci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNqozQ8uaV8), Jewish man from Long Island who has never set foot in the Middle East, but who might have had ancestors in the region 2000 years ago, he gets the right of return, and even the right to live in a stolen Palestinian home.

- A  Palestinian family who was ethnically cleansed from their lands by Israel in 1948 or 1967, [they don’t get their right of return](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2019/05/israels-refusal-to-grant-palestinian-refugees-right-to-return-has-fuelled-seven-decades-of-suffering/).

The [2003 citizenship law](https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-citizenship-law-advances-months-after-ban-on-palestinian-spouses-lapsed/) prevents the naturalization of Palestinians from the occupied West Bank or Gaza who are married to Israeli citizens, forcing thousands of Palestinian families to either emigrate or live apart.

[Interfaith and non-religious marriage are not allowed](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2016/03/08/intergroup-marriage-and-friendship/) in Israel, to prevent non-Jews from marrying Jews. This is eerily similar to the Apartheid South Africa's [Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act](https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/prohibition-mixed-marriages-act-commences).

In 2011, the Knesset passed the Amendment No. 40 to the Budgets Foundations Law, also known as the “[Nakba Law](https://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/496)”. This law authorizes the Minister of Finance to withdraw state funds from any institution or body that commemorates “Israel’s Independence Day or the day on which the state was established as a day of mourning”, or that denies the existence of Israel as a “Jewish and democratic state.”

I could go on about other discriminatory laws, if you would like to read more, the Palestinian Human Rights NGO in Israel Adalah has compiled [a list of more than 60 discriminatory laws guaranteeing Jewish supremacy](https://www.adalah.org/en/law/index).

This is important, since the definition of apartheid we saw above, included **establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons**. We can clearly see that Palestinians with Israeli citizenship don’t have equal rights according to Israeli law, it is in fact the opposite, Israeli law enforces Jewish domination.

&nbsp;

- **It's not just legal discrimination - discrimination in practice**

On top of legal discrimination, what’s the situation on the ground, then? Even if the laws are unfair, how are living conditions of Palestinians with Israeli citizenship compared to Jewish citizens?

-There is a different education system for Jewish and Palestinian children, and the Jewish one receives more funding. These poorly funded schools contribute to their attaining lower levels of education and their reduced employment prospects and earning power compared to Israeli Jews.

- [More than half of the country’s Arab families were considered poor in 2020](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-know-about-arab-citizens-israel), compared to 40 percent of Jewish families. 

- They are barred from living in [hundreds of towns in Israel](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/03/30/israel-new-laws-marginalize-palestinian-arab-citizens)), which are for Jewish citizens only. 

- Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are seen as a [fifth-column in Israel](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-31/ty-article-opinion/.premium/arab-citizens-of-israel-face-a-cruel-quandary-our-state-is-fighting-our-own-people/0000018b-83ea-df47-a3df-ffeba6a60000) and are exempt from mandatory conscription in the IDF because they are seen as a potential threat.

- During the 2022 elections, [cameras were placed in predominantly Arab polling stations](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/world/middleeast/netanyahu-cameras-arab-voter-turnout.html), to discourage them from voting.

This discrimination in practice is acknowledged even by Israeli authorities. The [2003 Or Commission Report](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-official-summation-of-the-or-commission-report-september-2003) says :

>Government handling of the Arab sector has been primarily neglectful and discriminatory. The establishment did not show sufficient sensitivity to the needs of the Arab population, and did not take enough action in order to allocate state resources in an equal manner. The state did not do enough or try hard enough to create equality for its Arab citizens or to uproot discriminatory or unjust phenomenon. 

What do Israeli Jews think of their fellow “Israeli Arabs”?

- According to [2007 Association for Civil Rights in Israel poll](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3480345,00.html): ""Over two-thirds of Israeli teens believe Arabs to be less intelligent, uncultured and violent. Over a third of Israeli teens fear Arabs all together ... 50% of Israelis taking part said they would not live in the same building as Arabs, will not befriend, or let their children befriend Arabs and would not let Arabs into their homes.
- According to a [2016 Institute for National Security Studies poll](https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-only-20-of-jewish-israelis-see-arab-citizens-as-equals/), only 20% of Israeli Jews see Arab citizens as ""equals"".
- According to a [2016 Israeli Radio poll](https://www.972mag.com/poll-46-of-israeli-jews-dont-think-arabs-should-have-equal-rights/), 45% of Israeli Jews don’t think Arabs should have equal rights.
- According to a [2016 Pew Research poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/), 48% of Israeli Jews agree that all Arabs should be kicked from Israel.
- According to a [2016 Ma'agar Mochot poll](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/poll-almost-half-of-israeli-parents-dont-want-arabs-teaching-their-kids-455118), Almost half of Israeli Jews don't want Arabs teaching their kids.
- According to a [2018 Israel Democracy Institute poll](https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-poll-shows-strong-anti-arab-sentiment-among-israeli-jews/), Over half of respondents said they agreed to some extent with the statement: “Most Jews are better than most non-Jews because they were born Jews"". 88% of respondents said they would be disturbed to some degree if their son were to befriend an Arab girl. The number climbed to 90% when respondents were asked about their daughter befriending an Arab boy.


This is just some additional evidence to show that on top of legal discrimination, Palestinians with Israeli citizenship also face structural discrimination, and are for all intents and purposes, second class citizens. **This list is obviously far, far from being exhaustive, you could spend hours finding examples of how Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are discriminated against**.

With all the information given above, a case can clearly be made that there is in Israel a system of domination of Palestinians with Israeli citizenship by Zionists, and that they are systematically oppressed, which means that Israel is indeed guilty of crimes of apartheid according to the UN definition.

&nbsp;

- **Argument : But they have representation in parliament!**

It is true that unlike in Apartheid South Africa, Palestinian with Israeli citizenship do have political representation. Again, this is not an argument in and of itself, since like we have seen earlier, apartheid in this context does not mean having the exact same laws as Apartheid South Africa, but rather to commit acts to establish and maintain domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them. **The existence of Arab parties does not preclude a regime of Jewish supremacy**.

The Arab politicians and parties are legally not allowed to challenge the status quo : according to the [1958 Knesset Law](https://main.knesset.gov.il/EN/activity/documents/BasicLawsPDF/BasicLawTheKnesset.pdf), a candidate to the parliament of Israel (the Knesset) can't ""negate the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish state"". This means that if you argue that Israel should not be a Jewish but a multicultural state with equal rights to self determination for Palestinians and Jewish people, you are not allowed to run for parliament.

In practice too, Arab parties in Israel don’t have any impact and are nothing more than token opposition. There has also long been [an unwritten rule in Israeli politics](https://theconversation.com/historic-change-arab-political-parties-are-now-legitimate-partners-in-israels-politics-and-government-162461) to keep Arab parties out of government. In the 75 years that Israel has existed, how many times were Arab parties actually in government? It only happened two times, for about three years in total :


-In 1959, when the Israeli Arab parties Progress and Development and Cooperation and Brotherhood, with two MK each, joined the ninth government of David Ben Gurion, which lasted from from December 1959 to November 1961. They didn’t get any ministerial position. This was during the days of martial law, and Palestinians with Israeli citizenship [were pressured by the military administration to vote for Arab parties who supported Zionism](https://web.archive.org/web/20220210220223id_/https://watermark.silverchair.com/mediterraneanstu_29_1_65.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAyEwggMdBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMOMIIDCgIBADCCAwMGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMc2_GbkotoETpftHJAgEQgIIC1JURZ3jiAugxkID5N7a_A12zhSxx3uoo3vEIpoZTT2X1wh08uZ_5tBSZ62otsLciROKx4TnrE-VrAWTpbONLKIygwBJgd7wUZdBFexrVQi3MzVKCN5S7df4rmBgNYAASoDuXcRPp0BBXcj7kYhApJen6Xx1ybe4sH9gNRjveYurFCKihKVqj0HessUOmLn_MSzl4mt17rdmD9BA6UxNg4nHS7-5qvoT0rDYkHsoHoTQm0vhtXk7sW0Wu-H-xuWCXiqm3y2vmMTFkv_U0mdjmiux8pWfeYM0zbZ6HRBxf4TbhMdlzAv_3hWwTORz5W1D519S53ygFU0c9K-SIk5z6WSxq2KACF0J6ADKyoORnYoyADrpNiVStZTKsL3REP5kGcvQxdRN6MYdl1QLM3GsFBLC4ALy2sNzyf_e_upzzQXqAzer5VvXESadVbyGAmys5Xv4M9g8L_N_ZCh3IsFh_5C8B70ZGOH_QOwX1N9tnsqIwqHGRSUopm74-rF9Tm2_pmVowWRCybJKNNC-Tsvl3UUQ6vkmDyBGWU0rfARz_smJ7EsLX3PSm9BYMdvTDcJxLUsmKnK_2YM7D7r_PxTolkVCHJ2vEkDaAyLeG_K235AfFw2vl-pzszPLE7VK4nHXjFUrwOtbrwZeQYnhJgvjGhE8cylhnB8V8Pp9ZOEnTjHiw-SmpFv8PnX99wj_raE8zQdl3qQFL-6aOL_nTvRNVpWWMbOA6nEHdnXtnh_3_60JzhqBXgMnUuYIVuAzDhlXENARZx5IkVfykwtnxfeN2T7mAmmTBKwAaE8e1u-HYHe3COQUMRjeBfCxYDmpQhFpdkO0ty2nAK2h_QeJcm5lPaFTi0FW7aNNBDyq3DP3i3i07d3iubPkaCYI1L9KDlJYQux3WazoQa7WeiTSDRZfiIJKX4v4YNYdIJUFrBVGtqXX3oXU4edtwDb8xi0fn15Sg9qwyoto).

- In 2021, the United Arab List joined the thirty-sixth government of Israeli headed Naftali Bennett after winning 4 seats in the last election. The government barely lasted more than a year, from June 2021 to December 2022. The only ministerial position the United Arab list received was the role of Minister without a portfolio for Mansour Abbas.

There have also been two other Palestinian Ministers, [Raleb Majadele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleb_Majadele), who was appointed appointed Minister without Portfolio in January 2007. Between March 2007 - March 2009 he served as Minister of Science, Culture and sports, for the Labor Party, and [Issawi Frej](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issawi_Frej), who served as Minister of Regional Cooperation. Neither of them threatened the status quo and both of them were members of Zionist parties (Labor and Meretz). Issawi Frej even helped to negotiate parts of the Abraham Accords, so he's fully on board with Zionism.

So yes, Palestinians with Israeli citizenship can vote, but their votes are meaningless, since their representatives are legally not allowed to challenge the status quo, they are almost never included in governments, and the few times they were it was not an important position. In a way, the existence of these token parties provide a convenient excuse for Zionists who claim there is no apartheid in Israel, since the existence of these parties provides them ammunition while in reality Arab parties don’t have any meaningful influence on Israeli politics.


&nbsp;

- **Argument : But a Supreme Court Justice is Palestinian!**

Regarding Supreme Court Justices, it is also true that there have been Palestinian supreme court justices in Israel. This was not the case in Apartheid South Aafrica, but I will repeat it again, you don’t need to have the exact same policies as Apartheid SA to commit crimes of apartheid. There have been four Palestinian Supreme Court Justices  :
 
- [Abdel Rahman Zuabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Rahman_Zuabi), Palestinian Muslim who was appointed for 9 months in 1999 and 2000;
- [Salim Joubran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salim_Joubran), Palestinian Christian who served as permanent member from 2003 to 2017,
- [George Karra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Karra), Palestinian Christian who served as permanent member from 2017 to 2022,
- [Khaled Kabub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Kabub), Palestinian Muslim who was appointed as permanent member in 2022.

There are 15 members on the Israeli Supreme Court, yet there has only ever been one Arab Supreme Justice at the time. There is an unwritten rule that there is [“only one Arab seat](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5120228,00.html)” at the court, despite Palestinians being 20% of the population, meaning a proportional representation would be three seats (20% of 15 = 3).

But even if representation at the Supreme Court was proportional, it would still be meaningless. Palestinian Justices still wouldn’t have the numbers to strike down legislation that is discriminatory towards other Palestinians.  In 2018, when the discriminatory Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People was promulgated, petitions were filed with the Supreme Court of Israel challenging the constitutionality of the law. The Supreme Court upheld the law, [with only one judge dissenting](https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-israel-religion-laws-courts-f1f529741ebf4abfed8562685a8c47fc), Palestinian judge George Karra. He was allowed to express his dissent, but not to challenge the status quo, since like we saw, there is only one token seat for Palestinians. The other Jewish Israeli judges of course voted to uphold the law, so it was passed. 

This is a good example of tokenism, as defined by the Merriam Webster dictionary :  “the practice of doing something (such as hiring a person who belongs to a minority group) only to prevent criticism and give the appearance that people are being treated fairly”. 

In that sense, Palestinian Supreme Justices are similar to Palestinian members of the Knesset, in that their existence provides ammunition for Zionists who claim there is no apartheid in Israel, but in practice they simply cannot prevent the ""domination by one racial group of persons over another"".

- **Don’t forget Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West bank, Gaza, and refugees.**

So far, we have only talked about Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. In the discussion of Israel as an apartheid state, we should also talk about the Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West bank, Gaza, and Palestinian refugees in third countries. You might ask, why should we talk about them, since they are not citizens of Israel? How can they be victims of apartheid when they’re citizens of another country? I will mostly be quoting [the report]( https://www.btselem.org/publications/fulltext/202101_this_is_apartheid) ""A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea"" by Israeli NGO B’Tselem here, who did some fantastic work summarizing the issue :

- After the war of 1967, Israel illegally annexed East Jerusalem. According to Israel itself, it is an integral part of its territory. Yet it never gave citizenship to the 361,700 who currently live there. Palestinians from East Jerusalem are defined as “permanent residents of Israel”. They can vote in local elections, but not national ones, and their permanent resident status can be revoked at any time by the Israeli Ministry of Interior, and in certain circumstances, it can also expire.

- Although Israel never formally annexed the West Bank, it treats the territory as its own. More than 2.6 million Palestinian subjects live in the West Bank, in dozens of disconnected enclaves, under rigid military rule and without political rights. In about 40% of the territory, Israel has transferred some civilian powers to the Palestinian Authority (PA). However, the PA is still subordinate to Israel and can only exercise its limited powers with Israel’s consent.

- The Gaza Strip is home to about two million Palestinians, also denied political rights. In 2005, Israel withdrew its forces from the Gaza Strip, dismantled the settlements it built there and abdicated any responsibility for the fate of the Palestinian population. After the Hamas takeover in 2007, Israel imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip that is still in place. Throughout all of these years, Israel has continued to control nearly every aspect of life in Gaza from outside : it controls Gaza's air and maritime space, as well as six of Gaza's seven land crossings. In the Rafah crossing, the only one not control by Israel, imports crossings require Israeli approval. It reserves the right to enter Gaza at will with its military and maintains a no-go buffer zone within the Gaza territory. It controls the entry of humanitarian aid, and even the electricity that goes into Gaza. Israel also controls [the amount of calories that enters Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/israeli-military-calorie-limit-gaza).

- Like we saw earlier when we talked about the law of return, Jews, as well as their children, grandchildren, and spouses, have the right to move to Israel and automatically gain citizenship. Palestinians and their descendants have no legal right to return to the lands their families held before being ethnically cleansed in 1948 or 1967.


The lives of the Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza or in refugee camps are effectively all controlled by Israel to some degree, yet they have even less rights than Palestinians with Israeli citizenship.


&nbsp;

- **Conclusion**

The existence of Palestinians with Israeli citizenship does not disprove the fact that Israel could have committed crimes of apartheid as defined in article II of the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. We have seen that they do not enjoy equal legal rights, that they face heavy discrimination in all aspects of life, that they only have token representation in parliament and the supreme court, and that Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza, Palestinian refugees and their descendants are also effectively controlled by Israel to some degree and face even more discrimination.",20/03/24 07:36:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bj7xw0/israel_cant_be_an_apartheid_state_because_of/,71,518,3739,Oct 2023,top,all
1b7x8xn,"Pre Oct 7th, 500-600 trucks going into Gaza = Dishonest reporting","Any report, article, opinion, post, comment or video which discusses aid in Gaza, always points out that prior to Oct 7th 500-600 trucks entered Gaza on a daily basis. This is repeated again and again as a comparison to the number of trucks entering Gaza now - to show how little aid is going in compared to what is needed.

The only source I could find for this information is a quote by Stephene Dujarric, UN spokesperson, (which only mentions 500)

https://press.un.org/en/2023/db231026.doc.htm

So where did he get it from? There is OCHA report from August 2023 detailing the ins and outs from Gaza 

https://www.ochaopt.org/content/movement-and-out-gaza-update-covering-august-2023

Quote:

>In August, 12,076 truckloads of authorized goods entered Gaza through the Israeli and Egyptian-controlled crossings.

That averages to 400 trucks a day.

The report details what is in those trucks:

>Among the goods that entered Gaza, 42 per cent were construction materials, and 22 per cent were food supplies. About 3 per cent were humanitarian aid items facilitated by international organizations, primarily food and medical supplies.

That is just under 90 food trucks per day! 

What sort of honest reporting is it that everywhere, from the Guardian, BBC, CNN, etc  insist on mentioning the 500-600 quote without any qualifications as to how it doesn't mean what they are implying ?

Note: I'm not discussing how many trucks are needed, as I'm sure they need more than the previous 90. Also they need trucks with medical supplies. So 90 trucks a day isn't sufficient for Gaza's current needs. My point is that this is dishonest and misleading reporting.



Some comments show that not everyone understands why this is important. 

One of the comments linked to an article:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/03/gaza-aid-convoy-israel-war/

>About 500 trucks entered Gaza each day before the war, a figure that aid agencies have not come close to reaching since the start of the conflict. In February, just 98 trucks per day crossed into Gaza on average, according to the United Nations, compared with an average of 170 per day in January. On several days last month, the number of trucks was in the single digits.

If the WP would have used correct values, it would have looked like this:

>About 100 food trucks entered Gaza each day before the war, ~~a figure that aid agencies have not come close to reaching since the start of the conflict~~. In February, just 98 trucks per day crossed into Gaza on average, according to the United Nations, compared with an average of 170 per day in January. On several days last month, the number of trucks was in the single digits.

I took out the sentence ""a figure that aid agencies have not come close to reaching since the start of the conflict""  because it no longer made sense. Since even the lower 98 is almost 100.

Do you notice the difference in impact between the two versions? They tell a completely different story. the average reader would say ""hey, 170 per day, that's much more than before the war. Looks like they are getting plenty of aid."" In which case, I highly doubt the WP would have even mentioned the 100 food trucks because that isn't the story they want to tell. They want to show how little aid is coming in. 

(I agree that aid into Gaza isn't just food. But none of the other numbers in the report can fall under aid. Also, I'm illustrating a point in reporting, not saying that Gaza only needs 100 trucks of aid).

The paragraph contains another trick they use to mislead the reader. Notice how they write ""In February, just 98 trucks per day crossed into Gaza **on average**"", and then they write ""On several days last month, the number of trucks was in the single digits."" To the average reader, the second sentence deminished the ""98 trucks per day"" as if the numbers are much less then 98. But it's 98 **on average**, which means it already accounts for those days with lower numbers, and there would be days with numbers much higher than 98 to counter those low days. 

They won't mention that as they want to show as low a number as they can, and imply it's even lower.  This is called ""dishonest reporting"", implying to the reader something which isn't true.

17842nj,"Gaza war moderation update Oct 14, 2023","First off this is a metapost. Discussion about the sub is invited in comments beneath this post as you can see from the flair. 

r/IsraelPalestine has policies of disclosure and transparency.  I want to provide an update on moderation to the sub's userbase.  The Oct 7th attack by Hamas was massively damaging to Israel.  Israelis are experiencing real cultural trauma from it.  Very analogous to what Americans went through on Sept 11, 2001.   Quite a lot of the moderators on this sub are Israeli, and they are going through this trauma.  Some moderators have lost family.  Far more of our user base is acting up than normal violating sitewide rules because they are stressed.  At the same time this sub is seeing the largest surge in new users it has ever experienced both in terms of absolute numbers and in terms of daily basis percentage increases.  Over the years I've had to do these reports generally when there is violence in the West Bank or Gaza.  Generally our sub has held up very well to reasonably well.  This time the status report is going to be more of a mixed bag.  Because the attack on Israel is coming so close temporally with the regime change operation in Gaza we are getting and will continue to get a lots of occasional users objecting to the Israeli on Gazan violence to come over the next weeks. Which means the mod team is not going to get a chance to find our balance. 

Over the last week we had days of 1000 reports / day.  Low days were around 300.   This is simply more than the mod team can handle by about 6-fold.  We are not under pressure, we simply flooded. To handle this volume we implemented 4 automatic removal scripts.  As our rules clearly state moderators don't make use of remove very much, rather we add a disciplinary warning comment by hand (and sometimes the automod does so) sometimes tracking it against the user.  Removes are reserved for flames, sitewide violations, spam, or particularly problematic comments.  That has not been happening.  We've had a ton of removes based on scripts.  Those scripts have had a lot of false positives.  I'd estimate we might have removed as many as 1000 rules compliant comments in using these scripts. That is totally unacceptable both to you and to us.  We have turned to the script aggressiveness down and will continue to experiment to see if any of these scripts are viable.  

One we may continue to use for a few more weeks is the low sub karma script which is more aggressive against users who are heavily downvoted and less aggressive against users who are heavily upvoted. This script appears to be having the most positive impact on reducing reports.  Our policy for years has been that voting is an annoying feature of Reddit that we wish we could disable but can't.  We have experimented a few times with various ways to diminish it with mixed success, none of those means are being employed now.   As we have acknowledged many times for years, we have more pro-Israeli than pro-Palestinian users which means the voting on this sub is quite biased.  Combining a rule enforcement system with a detection system known to be unfair and biased means unequal enforcement. That is to say a greater percentage of comments from pro-Palestinian posters will be incorrectly removed under this system.  This is completely unfair, antithetical to the whole ethos of a debate sub and something we urgently need to address.  As a sub we are trying to stay compliant with Reddit's sitewide rules about moderators handling their duties. This is especially important on issues of ethnic conflict which Reddit is very worried about, and of course this is top story in many global newspapers which further raises the scrutiny.  While the mods don't have a great solution as of today we at least want to be transparent this is happening, which is the least this sub's mods can do.   If you are a pro-Palestinian poster with an important well written comment you see removed incorrectly please flag a mod directly.  We can add you as an approved user if you have a history of good comments which I believe we can detect in the script. At the very least we can restore the comment and hopefully adjust the AI by notifying the AI of this and other removes. 

The second major announcement is a temporary rules change. We are going to call this ""rule 20: the IDF safety announcement rule"".  It will not be on the sidebar due to Reddit limitations.   The IDF is going to be sending safety information to Gazan civilians.   Hamas is deliberately sending out misinformation to Gazan civilians regarding safety information to help them maintain human shields.   We have lots of leftist ""speak truth to power"" types who tend to dislike authority picking these memes up. In this conflict we have many quasi-newsish sites putting out a lot of fake reports to get click revenue.    The IDF is doing a poor job of keeping their military operations fully consist with their advice to Gazan civilians.  Quite rightfully, but quite harmfully, this inconsistency is undermining IDF's credibility on these safety warnings. Generally as a sub we come down hard on the side of debate and against demanding adherence to a particular viewpoint.  We think free speech is vital, and free debate is vital.  However, at the end of the day on this issue we think it is more important to make sure that any Gazans reading this sub get accurate safety information than that we allow free speech and free debate about what the safety information is.  This is a debate that could quite literally get people killed.   So effective immediately under rule 20 debating IDF instructions or comments that are misleading about IDF instructions will be removed, and any mod can ban on this offense without further warning.  You still do have appeal rights under rule 13 for rule 20 violations.  This is another rule we intend to rescind as quickly as possible, because it is yet again us putting our thumb on the scale between the IDF and Hamas. 

Finally, since the root cause of both of the above is the fact that we are flooded I'm going to break with another policy.  We generally do not like to promote mods during news related surges.  We promote during quiet times to make sure people have a chance to ask questions and get coaching when we have excess moderators.  We have promoted some temporary mods who have experience on other large volume subs but lack the knowledge of details of the conflict we would normally demand of a mod.  But I'm asking users, particularly non-Israeli users, who have been regulars even if they haven't been and would like to mod to let us know you are willing. If you get selected you'll get brought on with less support and warm up time than normal but at this point something is better than nothing. I'd also ask any less active mods to help out with report queue if you can. 

Obviously a lot of this is controversial we genuinely welcome comments and questions. And of course as this is a metapost as usual this is the right place to discuss anything else about the sub you would like to discuss.",15/10/23 01:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17842nj/gaza_war_moderation_update_oct_14_2023/,39,114,1235,Oct 2023,top,all
17wz3rp,The IDF is committing war crimes! Or is it?,"Forward: There are a lot of accusations flowing around that Israel is committing war crimes. Most people just throw those accusations without knowing what a war crime is and how urban combat is fought, for example not every civilian death is a war crime and fighting in a city is also not a war crime. So, this is meant to be a kind of a guide to the rules of war in urban warfare. If you really care about the situation and you don’t just want to throw words like “war crimes” around I suggest you give this a read. 

  
Chapter 1 – understanding Urban warfare:  
To understand the legality and morality of Israel’s actions in Gaza it is important to understand what urban warfare is and how destructive it is by its nature, especially when fighting a group like Hamas that uses Guerrilla tactics.   
Urban warfare is the most devastating type of warfare from a civilian and military casualties’ perspective. A good example to put the war in Gaza into perspective is the battle of Mosul against ISIS. According to the British ministry of defense at least 9,000 civilians were likely killed in Mosul and most of the city turned into uninhabitable ruins. And other Urban battles against militant forces thought history have resulted in similar outcomes. But why?  
Because of the tactics used by militant forces, and because of the density of the cities. The militant force usually uses civilian infrastructure as military bases of operations, and they hide among civilians. Because of this no matter how hard the attacking force tries to minimize civilian casualties, their numbers would still be high. Sometimes simply because of their presence in the area, they can get caught in the crossfire between the attacking force and the defending militant force. And the attacking force always has to balance between protecting civilians and protecting its troops. For Example, if a militant force fires from a building with civilians inside, an attacking force eliminating the threat risks killing civilians but not eliminating the threat risks the attacking’s force troops dying. This is just one of thousands of different scenarios you could meet in an urban battle. This is one of the reasons why evacuating civilians is so important.

  
Chapter 2- Understanding the situation in Gaza:  
In Gaza the situation is even more difficult than it was in Mosul. For one, there are more militants in Gaza. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad have more than 30,000 militants in the Gaza strip (ISIS had around 10,00-12,000 militants in Mosul). Gaza city is more densely populated than Mosul and Hamas had 15 years to build their infrastructure because they had control over and served as the government of Gaza since they won the Palestinian civil war against Fatah in 2007. Hamas has weapon storages and command centers in civilian buildings, they have tunnels everywhere and in particular under Hospitals and schools and they shoot rockets at Israel from densely populated areas, rockets that sometimes fail and land in Gaza causing destruction and civilian casualties. For example, according to the IDF since the start of the war more than 1000 Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets have landed inside the Gaza strip. One can only imagine how many of civilians died because of those rockets. Especially considering the fact that they fall in random places. Furthermore, it is important to note that there is a problem with the number of casualties coming out of Gaza. Hamas controls the Gaza health ministry that provides those numbers and they don’t provide any numbers about the number of militants killed. Taking into account the fact that their militants wear civilian clothing so they can easily be identified as civilians and it is likely that they are counted as such. If we look at the 2014 war in Gaza about 33%-44% of the casualties were terrorists (estimates vary because of the points stated earlier). while a total of 60% of all casualties were males of age fit to fight. It is safe to assume that the numbers in the cornet war would be similar.    
  
Chapter 3- introduction to international laws of war:  
The international laws of war or ILOW in short have 3 main principles used to decide whether an action is legal or not.   
Those are military necessity, proportionality and honor  
Now it is important to note the ILOW principles and laws apply differently when talking about war between two state militaries and a fight between a military force and a militant force.  
Military necessity - “justifies certain actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible.” Or in other words, how much does the action contribute the military goal. For example, destroying a weapons storage hinders the enemy’s ability to fight you and thus it is a military necessity. Actions that aren’t necessary to achieve the military goals are forbidden. For example, targeting specifically civilian populations is not a military necessity. Now when the enemy uses civilian infrastructure like in Gaza you go into a grey area which leads us to the second principal.    
proportionality – “requires that even when actions may be justified by military necessity, such actions not be unreasonable or excessive.” Now this one is a lot of times misunderstood. There isn’t a ratio between civilian casualties and militant casualties or between casualties on both sides that must not be passed. This principal means that when you take some sort of action the military gain must be high enough to justify possible harm that could be caused to civilians. For example, killing a commander that hides in a civilian area can be considered justified because a high-ranking commander’s death can greatly hinder the enemy’s ability to fight. Though the harm to civilians should be minimized as much as possible. The two sides must also distinguish between the civilian population and the fighting force. This basically says that you cannot target civilians. And when one of the sides uses the civilian population as human shields (which is forbidden), the other side must try to distinguish between those two as much as it can.  
Honor- Basically says that all parties must respect the principles and rules of war.  
Now you may notice that those principles aren’t black and white and it is because war is complicated and there is an understanding that no matter how hard you try civilian harm cannot be entirely avoided, especially in urban combat like mentioned earlier.  
  
Chapter 4 – Israel’s approach to protecting civilians:  
Israel implements several approaches to protect the civilian population inside of the war zone. First of all, Israel implements a system of warning people inside of buildings by calling and “roof knowing” which is dropping a small ammunition on the roof of the buildings to make the people get out before they bomb the building. They do it whenever possible even though it helps militants escape too. Furthermore, Israel has been evacuating the areas where the center of the fighting is. Days before they started the ground invasion, they have called for civilians in Gaza city to evacuate south where it is relatively safer, and where humanitarian aid is allowed to flow. Even after the ground invasion has started the IDF has kept an evacuation route open on a daily basis to allow civilians to escape. Israeli troops also have orders to shoot only at militants.  
When dealing with buildings like Hospitals that Hamas uses, Israel goes slowly and lets civilians escape before they go in. For example, they have been in the Shifa hospital area a few days before they started an operation in the building.      
  
Chapter 5 – Analyzing Israel’s actions:  
First of all, lets determine if the act of Israel going to war itself is legal. The answer is yes. After Hamas attacked Israel, butchered its people and took more than 200 hostages. Israel has the right to fight them back. According to international law a country has the right to defend itself from state or non-state actors. Also, the goal of eliminating Hamas can be considered legal because Hamas poses a risk to the people living in Israel. So, Israel has the right to ensure that Hamas won’t be able to harm its people again.   
Now even though the act of war itself is legal Israel still has to respect the laws of war so let’s examine them.  
The targets:  
As mentioned before Hamas’s military infrastructure and militants are imbedded inside of the civilian population of Gaza. And according to the rules of war, if one side uses civilian areas for military purposes those areas become legal targets. For example, if Hamas uses a house to store weapons this house is a legal military target.   
With that out of the way lets examine Israel’s targets according to the three principles of war. First of all, the targets Israel picks are military targets. It attacks weapon storages, command centers, tunnel entrances, missile launching sites, units like anti-tank units and other Hamas militants, high ranking commanders and more. The problem is that they are all placed inside of civilian areas. But all of those targets pass the military necessity test because they hinder Hama’s ability to fight. For example, destroying a launching site hinders Hamas’s ability to launch rockets into Israel and destroying a command center hinders Hamas ability to stay coordinated.   
Now let’s look at proportionality, Israel uses a lot of precision guided missiles to eliminate its targets. Ammunition like that helps minimize civilian harm because it strikes the exact target. Now does it mean that civilians don’t die in these strikes? No, as I said no matter how hard you try to minimize civilian lose, there would still be civilian loses. Israel’s implementation of warning people in the buildings when it can, shows that it is also distinguishing between militants and civilians. Remember that the IDF always has to balance between protecting civilians in Gaza and protecting its soldiers and Israeli civilians.   
In the rules of war there are building which are considered protected like hospitals and mosques. But when a group like Hamas uses them for military purposes, they lose their protected status. Israel is also seen implementing the principal of proportionality and distinction when dealing with those buildings. When they went to clear the Shifa hospital and other hospitals they moved slowly and provided time for civilians to escape. They also went in with medical and arab speaking personal to help the civilians inside. which also shows that they distinguish between civilians and militants.  
Forcible displacement of civilians versus lawful evacuation:  
“The prohibition on forcible displacement is subject to an important exception in cases where the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons (such as clearing a combat zone) require the evacuation” Israel asking civilian to evacuated northern Gaza because it is an active war zone is not only legal but it shows that Israel implements the principal of proportionality and distinguishing because they evacuate civilians to safer areas. Israel also put troops on the evacuation corridors to secure them after Hamas blocked them.   
Siege tactics, “collective punishment” and access to humanitarian relief:  
Siege tactics are allowed to be used in combat but they also must respect the principles of war. Israel allows aid to flow into southern Gaza, each day hundreds of trucks pass through the Rafa gate. And remember that even though the Rafa gate is on the Egyptian side, all the trucks must get inspected by Israel to check if they contain weapons and so Israel decides if aid is allowed in or not. Israel does not allow aid to flow into the north of Gaza where most of the fighting is thus putting it under siege. This passes the military necessity test because it hinders Hamas’s ability to fight. And the fact that the IDF evacuates civilians from the north to the south where aid is available shows that they distinguish between civilians and militants. This distinguishment also shows that it is not a collective punishment. In addition, Israel has to allow aid to flow in but they are not the ones responsible for where the aid lands in the end. If the claims that Hamas stockpiles fuel and steals aid are true (and there is some evidence that it is) than Hamas is at fault for aid not getting to civilians in Gaza, not Israel. Also, when Israel encircled the Shifa hospital and effectively put it under siege they allowed aid to pass to the hospital.  
In my conclusion, according to the information available at this time it seems that Israel is flowing the rules of war. Some people may think differently.

17zox73,Public support for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza appears to be dropping in the U.K.,"

I wonder what the reason for this change could be. Some commentators have suggested that violent pro-Hamas protests on British streets are scaring people off.

So I like science and technology and actually care about scientific literacy. I'm going to demonstrate how the media and how disinformation may present itself in social media. First, disinformation is blatant spread of untrue information, or propaganda. Misinformation is accidental spread, so unintentional propaganda.

If you are going to engage with someone online, there are only two ways to engage:

1. on the merits of the statistical analysis or the merits of the methodology. There are many statistical analysis techniques available, and many exist to account for biases, skewed data, and other statistical properties. It is actually up to the researcher/PI to justify why they chose that particular methodology or analysis technique.
2. on the merits of their arguments. We start with the Tablet [article](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-gaza-health-ministry-fakes-casualty-numbers).

If we actually pay attention to his words and use a little bit of reading comprehension we can see Wyner does not label his analysis as concrete evidence. Here is his original claim:

""If Hamas’ numbers are faked or fraudulent in some way, there may be evidence in the numbers themselves that can demonstrate it. While there is not much data available, there is a little, and it is enough: From Oct. 26 until Nov. 10, 2023, the Gaza Health Ministry released daily casualty figures that include both a total number and a specific number of women and children.""

Notice no definitive words stating his statistical evidence is 100% proof. In fact, if we continue with his narrative emphasizing certain points,

""This lack of correlation is the second circumstantial piece of evidence suggesting the numbers are not real.""

""Taken together, what does this all imply? While the evidence is not dispositive, it is highly suggestive that a process unconnected or loosely connected to reality was used to report the numbers.""

* In my opinion, he does make an interesting point regarding the linearity of the dataset, and how the women/children deaths do not correlate well to the men's death, and the linear increase between consecutive days where no fighting may occur. I'm of the belief he picked the initial 30 days, especially to demonstrate how the increase of casualties doesn't make sense, especially before the initial invasion.

He points to another article, the Washington Report, per his words, ""There are other obvious red flags. The Gaza Health Ministry has consistently claimed that about 70% of the casualties are women or children. This total is far higher than the numbers reported in earlier conflicts with Israel. Another red flag, raised by Salo Aizenberg and written about extensively, is that if 70% of the casualties are women and children and 25% of the population is adult male, then either Israel is not successfully eliminating Hamas fighters or adult male casualty counts are extremely low. This by itself strongly suggests that the numbers are at a minimum grossly inaccurate and quite probably outright faked. Finally, on Feb. 15, Hamas admitted to losing 6,000 of its fighters, which represents more than 20% of the total number of casualties reported.""

* I'm of the belief he draws most of his assumptions from this report. If you argue that the entirety of it is inaccurate, then you better demonstrate how, especially since I know some of the source materials are in a different language (to include Hebrew and Arabic), and this took a while to compile and verify.
* I'm not going to go into detail about his statistical analysis here. I understand what he is saying but the issue here is I do not understand his assumptions, since I feel he may be using a specific analysis technique. He actually posts this way to illicit a particular response (more on this later).

So if you actually read the article you can see he does put up a fine argument. If you argue he doesn't then you need to pick up a dictionary, seriously. If you argue a specific point, stop because he does say his statistical analysis does not hold up on it's own. Stop cherry-picking because we complain about newspaper editorializing scientific headlines and picking specific parts of the journal article. This is no different to here, when Wyner already mentioned how his analyses doesn't hold up on it's own. Circumstantial, deposition are both law words for instance, with specific implications. Even the ending/conclusion of Wyner's article states it is not 100% certainty. So literally, the majority of people are failing at reading comprehension, and cherry-picking. If you don't believe me read on.

Now some basics on researching the background of the author/PI and within their expertise: Start with Wyner's [biography](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ajw/#research).

We see that he is a consultant to law, investment banking, and other financial firms. Consultant law, supporting my previous argument that he does not believe his original statistical analysis holds up on it's own and his entire article is not concrete evidence.

People also brought up another statistician from Caltech, [Pachter](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2024/03/08/a-note-on-how-the-gaza-ministry-of-health-fakes-casualty-numbers/?unapproved=25888&moderation-hash=2d8b7b84ae3ff622f7882af368cd3136#respond).

If we are to go over his webpage, and specifically his commentary, he does not address the lack of correlation,

""I don’t know. There could be many reasons for these correlations. Maybe it’s an artifact of the age threshold for children and the distribution of age in Gaza. Maybe it’s the result of lags in recording deaths. Maybe it’s a happenstance arising from so few datapoints. Maybe the data was indeed faked. ""

* I'm of the belief he did not read the Washington Report to understand his assumptions, and that this Tablet article was probably a morning read for him.

Now, we compare the research and background of these two authors/investigators. This can be accomplished just by reading the titles of their recent research publications. Click on the ""research"" tab that will usually be located on their webpage. If you have trouble, just Google, ""<last name> research group"" and throw in a keyword of the research institution, for example, ""pachter research caltech"" and you should be able to access his research page. Likewise for Wyner. The [two](https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people/lior-s-pachter#publications-b4dab8c0-tab) [links](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ajw/#research) for reference are.

Now everything makes sense. We can see Pachter's field of expertise deals with computational biology, specifically large datasets. YUUGEE datasets. So it makes sense for him to use the analyses he did. Now we look at Wyner's webpage. We see his field of expertise deals with small datasets, specifically making risky decisions with small datasets, not so yuge. It even looks like Wyner is really good at making those risky decisions with limited datasets as well (law, banking). This concludes why they are technically both correct within their respective field of research. A little more research into Wyner's Tablet [webpage](https://www.tabletmag.com/contributors/abraham-wyner).

Just from a quick glance we see he writes these articles with very ragebait titles. If we glance on the second article titled, ""The Insanity of Mandating Camp Boosters for Kids,"" we are tempted to grab our pitchforks. However, skimming through the article we see that he is talking specifically about BOOSTERS for kids. Didn't read third article but wouldn't be surprised if there was clarifying information. This additionally supports my statement on why he does not disclose his assumptions.

A note on biases, yes he is biased and yes the Washington report is biased. However, every author/research group will be biased, that is the point of peer-review. In fact, you can even tell which research article may belong to which research group (since there are limited groups).

Some may argue that this is shitty analysis. Either way, it is still data. Even bad data can be considered good data nowadays with AI/ML. I actually published very shitty results with good data, so I can argue that all data is useful nowadays. Especially true since companies are now selling information. Yes, there are plenty of people with PhDs who don't know what they're talking about. I will most likely be one of them, but I know when to stfu. The people that are vocal and actually know their crap (Wyner, Pachter) do know their stuff. It's very hard to be a professor, probably like getting into the NFL. It's because freedom of research and tenured (no fear of retaliation for political research/activities) positions are limited. 

Like I said, I was curious on social media information, but I figured this would be useful for people that care on how to analyze scientific/statistical media.",16/03/24 14:41:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1bg7kwj/a_note_on_the_gaza_death_toll_wyner_pachter_and/,27,207,1511,Oct 2023,top,all

1asd356,What are British attitudes to the Israel-Gaza conflict?,"This poll was conducted by [YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/), YouGov is a British international online research and data analytics firm. They specialize in market research and opinion polling, collecting data through online methods from a panel of over 24 million people worldwide.

This poll was conducted on 2092 GB adults, the sample size is small so take the results with a grain of salt, the poll was taken first on Nov 16, 2023, and was conducted again on Feb 13, 2024, the poll asks fairly common I'll try and list some of them below.

**Which side do you sympathize with more?**

**Do you support Israel to continue its military objectives, or are you calling for a ceasefire?**

**Do you believe there is a permanent peace settlement?**

**And what does that permanent peace settlement look like?**

&#x200B;

From looking at the results, it seems that as time goes by, more and more people are less supporting Isreal, this, however, does not mean that they support Palestine, more that they are now not so sure who to support as how they've been prior to when the current conflict started, it seems that the peak for Israel's support was on Oct 7th and it went downhill from there, it is the opposite for Palestine, as their pit was also on Oct 7th and it trended upward, it seems that more and more people who support both sides are supporting one side or the other.

The most interesting point for me was the solutions for the conflict, the most popular one was a 2SS followed by 1SS, the last three solutions did not find much support, they were:

1-Status Quo

2-Ethnic cleansing of Palestenians

3-Ethnic cleansing of Jews

I honestly thought that from looking at the discourse in this sub more people would be saying they are for the ethnic cleansing of Jews, it seems that more people are for the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

17laxym,Hamas cynical use of Palestinians as human shields,"Just because I keep getting the “there is no evidence of Hamas using human shields” sentence, I compiled a short list of evidence, anyone can copy it and find it easily online, I decided to put it here for everyone to see.

I’m sick of the pretending and mental gymnastics people use to say there is no evidence to something so well captured for decades.

Let’s start with the basics, THE ENTIRETY of Gaza is riddled with Hamas tunnels below it, basically turning the entire Gaza Strip to a human shield on steroids, below hospitals, schools, houses, mosques, churches, UNRWA buildings, restaurants, EVERYONE is a human shield.

Hamas even said they don’t need to take care of their people’s safety, because they are “refugees” “the UN and Israel should take care of them”, such callousness is beyond me how can anyone support this?

176b0cw,"Hamas called for ""Global Jihad Day"" on Friday, October 13th, 2023. What to expect? Global protests?","What do you think will happen worldwide during ""Global Jihad Day"" on Friday, October 13th, 2023? I'm expecting global protests and rallies to support Palestine and counter-rallies to support Israel. Do you think there is a credible threat against Jewish organizations, Cultural Centres, Synagogues by terrorists or militants that have infiltrated Western countries like the USA, Canada, UK, France, Germany etc outside of Israel or will it just be some big protests in major cities with flags and signs? 

""An official statement from the Hamas terrorist organization and comments from a former Hamas leader—both calling for global mobilization against Israel this Friday, Oct. 13—are raising alarm at Jewish organizations and among those who monitor the Middle East.  
“The real threat here is that there is no way of knowing who, if anyone, will take up the call or if there are pre-planned actions already staged elsewhere in the world just waiting for the greenlight,” according to James Carafano, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation and senior counselor to its president.

On Oct. 10, Hamas called for an “Al-Aqsa Flood Friday” on Oct. 13, according to a translation from the Middle East Media Research Institute. In the statement, the terror organization sought reinforcements from “our Palestinian people, the masses of the Arab and Islamic world, and free people worldwide” in its “declaration of mobilization.”  
Also on Oct. 10, the Qatar-based Khaled Mashal, who led Hamas from 2014-2017, called for Muslims to “take to the streets” on Friday in a global protest against Israel. “To all scholars who teach jihad,” he said, “to all who teach and learn, this is a moment for the application \[of jihad\].”  
“It is an unambiguous global call to arms,” Robert Greenway, director of the Center for National Defense at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Signal. “It will be heeded. There will be blood.”  
Melissa Lantsman, the deputy Canadian opposition leader, stated that the “dangerous and hateful rhetoric from Hamas terrorists inciting violence this Friday around the world must be taken seriously.”  
“They have already inspired large protests in support of their evil acts. All levels of government must ensure adequate security and protective measures are in place for Jewish schools, synagogues and community centers across the country,” she said.  
The UJA Federation of Greater Toronto said that it was monitoring the situation but there was no known specific threat.""

18pmsw6,My blog analyzing the war - part 2.,"I am from India and an amateur blogger on geopolitics, with Indian national security and business.   
This is my latest post on the war:  
[https://rpdeans.blogspot.com/2023/12/the-gaza-war-by-numbers-2-months-later.html](https://rpdeans.blogspot.com/2023/12/the-gaza-war-by-numbers-2-months-later.html)

My post analyses casualties from both sides - and why I think they are credible. I argue that officer losses from among the IDF's frontline units will be a significant problem going forward. I look at what the victory conditions for both sides might look like and how long each side can sustain this. 

My blogposts on the Gaza war look at only the military aspect of the conflict. I post original data based   
analysis, which I started as means of getting the facts and then enabling a fact based discussion.  I do not represent anyone. The blog is free and I do not solicit advertising or subscribers, so I hope this is not removed for self promotion. I am not as close to the conflict as many readers, so I would appreciate feedback and corrections. 

I have done business with Israel and the Arab world and briefly worked in Iran, so I understand that the same facts can be perceived very differently by both sides. Having grown older and hopefully wiser, I've taken a more nuanced view of Middle East politics, rather than \`one side good one evil'.   
My position is that while Hamas's actions of 7th Oct are a terrorist act, Israel's response can lose it a lot of sympathy which can hurt it in the longer term.

18toyv9,"Chant, Rant, or Think. You choose.","I posted this on FB today (I guess yesterday) after reading the Heather Cox Richardson's [most recent substack installment](https://open.substack.com/pub/heathercoxrichardson/p/december-28-2023?r=vwu23&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email) which discusses the Massacre at Wounded Knee (Dec. 29 1890). I ended up writing an open letter to people de-legitimizing one side or the other in this conflict. I'm sure some of the things I state as fact (e.g. mythical narratives) will make certain folks angry. But I'm pretty sure everything I say stands up to academic scrutiny.

------

I'm not an expert on this, but from what I know about 20/20 hindsight on man-made catastrophes (Challenger disaster, Great Depression, Fukushima, rise of Hitler, etc., and TIL [the Wounded Knee Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre)) is that they usually result when an entire series of fail-safes fail, not just one or two. A perfect storm. In retrospect, we see unheeded warnings, and we try to learn how to do a better job of heeding them.

I don't know HCR's take on Israel, but I consider the Middle East Conflict (as we used to call Israel-v-Palestine back in the day, as if that was the only part of the Middle East that mattered) to be one of these events. For people who want to blame it on [the ship-builder, or the captain, or the ice berg](https://www.history.com/news/why-did-the-titanic-sink), and hold rallies on college campuses or on Portland bridges shouting ""SAVE THE ICE BERGS"" you probably think you all somehow channel [Michael Burry in The Big Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry#In_popular_culture).

To me, 20/20 hindsight about Israel looks like this: two competing visions of [nationalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/nationalism/European-nationalism) {[and](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/whp-1750/xcabef9ed3fc7da7b:unit-2-liberal-and-national-revolutions/xcabef9ed3fc7da7b:2-3-nationalism/a/read-origins-and-impacts-of-nationalism-beta1)} emerging at the same time in the same piece of land, land geographically destined throughout history to be in [political flux](https://www.commentary.org/articles/ray-alan/conquerors-causewaywhy-the-levant-is-levantine/) {[and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_ancient_Levant)} {[and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7xp1-VvtZ0)} , and at a time when the world was experiencing a radical change from empires (e.g. Brittish and Ottoman) to countries ([the countries of the Middle East, Near East, even Far East didn't even exist until after WWI](https://www.vox.com/a/maps-explain-the-middle-east)), and accompanied by the [largest human migrations the world had ever seen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_human_migration#World_wars_and_aftermath). The Middel East becomes a puzzle of pieces sketched out in Europes former imperial halls and given names reflecting the most favored peoples and tribes: [House of Saud: yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud). Afghans: yes. [Kurds: no](https://theconversation.com/why-there-is-no-kurdish-nation-126243). [Hashemites (Jordan): yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashemites). Armenians: no.

(**Aside:** The above is an oversimplification. But truly, the modern names and borders of almost all countries of the Near East, Middle East, and western Asia were assigned by or negotiated with either European countries or Russia or both starting in the mid 19th century.)

Britain promises too many things to too many people in Mandetory Palestine, and becomes overwhelmed by the ensuing chaos when all the people it promised things to come asking for it. It doesn't help that they all brought their friends. In 1948 the ancestors of the _vast majority of everyone living there_ had come from somewhere else in the preceding 150 years (since 1800 or so). The Jewish diaspora of course. But also Muslims from Egypt, Syria, and all over the former Ottoman empire, the entire Muslim world. Britain is no longer the seat of an Empire taking on the white man's burden. It wants get on with the new and modern role of being a simple country, and punts the two-state project in Mandetory Palestine to the newly born UN as it's very first assignment.

What does 20/20 hindsight show us? How could we have avoided Israel being a country birthed into perpetual war--attacked by all of its neighbors (new countries as well) on the day it declared independence--on May 14, 1948?

But that's not the question.

>One of the curses of history is that we cannot go back and change the course leading to disasters, no matter how much we might wish to. The past has its own terrible inevitability.
>
>But it is never too late to change the future.

It's not too late. But it also isn't simple. Some people speculate that [if we had gotten reconstruction right in this country we wouldn't have race problems today](https://time.com/5562869/reconstruction-history/). We didn't get it right. [And we are still dealing with it 170 years later](https://www.swarthmore.edu/news-events/eric-foner-significance-reconstruction-american-history).

We (the UN, the World) also didn't get it right in 1948 either. And we are still dealing with to fallout of that failure 75 years later in an ongoing battle of two competing mythical narratives about victimhood and statehood. I call them mythical because the facts on each side have been selected, exaggerated, and elevated to the status of holy truths.

If you think you have it all figured out and know what is right and what is wrong, who is right and who is wrong in Mandetory Palestine right now, by all means, keep chanting, keep judging. 

Keep accusing Israel of genocide if you think that will really help. Statistics show that Israel really really really REALLY sucks at genocide.

Keep saying the battle is with Hamas and not Palestinians, as if that will help feed new orphans in Gaza.

Lift up your voice to ""Free Palestine"", as if such a thing ever did exist. 

Say that ""Jews had Israel first"" as if such a thing actually existed.

Feel free to blame the battle on religion. That way you can remove yourself from the fight as an avowed athiest.

Feel free to use (and misuse) the terms ""Zionist"" and ""Jew"" as insults. You won't be the first.

Call for an IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE because that will......do......something? (pssst. There was a ceasefire in place on Oct. 6, 2023)

At some point, the current conflict is going to wind down. Gaza will be a gravel pit. Iran will be licking Hamas' wounds. The hostages will be dead, returned, or both. Netanyahu will be out. Palestinians will be utterly traumatized....again, and Israelis fearful and anxious....again. That's when the real conversation is going to happen. The big powers will all be there by proxy: US, Russia, Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, India. What happens next will be crucial. It will be what historians write about in 50 years as they try to figure out if we got it right in 2024.

So if you have 20/20 highsight and know who did what wrong when so you can judge who is doing what wrong now, then I guess you can go on chanting. Alternatively, think about what our leaders will need to hear when the real conversation starts. Take some time to learn about how we got to this point. Get off Tik Tok and sift through the multiple narrative mythologies for things that really did happen and what the context was. Learn about the rise of nationalism and the fall of empires. Learn about human migration. Learn about what it takes to build a country and make it work.

The stated goal of the military activities currently being conducted is “Damage not accuracy”. The most charitable interpretation of this is that the IDF cares significantly more about killing Hamas than civilian life.

A talking point is that Hamas is categorically evil because they target Israeli civilians. Let’s not forget the killing spree that West Bank settlers went on this summer. After all of this only 8 suspects were detained. Where was the rage from all if you now saying Hamas must be held accountable and MUST be killed to the last man now. Tell me you think the IDF would have acted with kid gloves if it was a Palestinian attack against the West Bank. And to top it off, Smotrich, the right wing finance minister I brought up, called for ""I think that Huwara needs to be erased… I think that the state of Israel needs to do it, but God forbid not individual people.""

Thus the claim that ""Palestine has been subjected 75 years of occupation"" is **only correct if one ignores which nations were the occupiers*, and would appear to **implicitly deny the validity of the Partition Plan, a/the major source of legitimacy for any two state solution**.

1773ji4,This Is Bad,"If this AP story is accurate, and the video post by Hamas seems very real, then the intelligence failure is even worse than everyone thinks even now.

Hamas practiced in plain sight, posting video of mock attack weeks before real assault  
A video posted on social media by the Hamas militant group last month shows a live-fire exercise outside a town in the southern Gaza Strip. (Hamas)

BY MICHAEL BIESECKER AND SARAH EL DEEB  
ASSOCIATED PRESS  
OCT. 13, 2023 3:56 AM PT  
  
Less than a month before Hamas fighters blew through Israel’s high-tech “Iron Wall” and launched an attack that would leave more than 1,200 Israelis dead, they practiced in a very public dress rehearsal.  
  
A slickly produced two-minute propaganda video posted on social media by Hamas on Sept. 12 shows fighters using explosives to blast through a replica of the Israel-Gaza border gate, sweep in on pickup trucks and then move building by building through a full-scale reconstruction of an Israeli town, firing automatic weapons at human-silhouetted paper targets.  
  
Hamas’ live-fire exercise, dubbed operation “Strong Pillar,” also had militants in body armor and combat fatigues carrying out operations that included the destruction of mock-ups of the border wall’s concrete towers and a communications antenna, just as they would do for real in Saturday’s deadly, multipronged attack.  
  
While Israel’s highly regarded security and intelligence services were clearly caught flatfooted by Hamas’ ability to breach its Gaza defenses, the group appears to have hidden its extensive preparations for the deadly assault in plain sight.  
  
“There clearly were warnings and indications that should have been picked up,” said Bradley Bowman, a former U.S. Army officer who is now senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington research institute. “Or maybe they were picked up, but they didn’t spark necessary preparations to prevent these horrific terrorist acts from happening.”  
  
The Associated Press reviewed and verified key details from dozens of videos Hamas released over the last year, primarily through the social media app Telegram.  
  
Using satellite imagery, the AP matched the location of the mocked-up town to a patch of desert outside Al-Mawasi, a Palestinian town on the southern coast of the Gaza Strip. A large sign in Hebrew and Arabic at the gate says “Horesh Yaron,” the name of a controversial Israeli settlement in the occupied Palestinian West Bank.  
  
Bowman said there are indications that Hamas intentionally led Israeli officials to believe it was preparing to carry out raids in the West Bank, rather than Gaza. It was also potentially significant that the exercise has been held annually since 2020 in December, but was moved up by nearly four months this year to coincide with the anniversary of Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from Gaza.  
  
In a separate video posted to Telegram from last year’s Strong Pillar exercise Dec. 28, Hamas fighters are shown storming what appears to be a mock-up Israeli military base, complete with a full-size model of a tank with an Israeli flag flying from its turret. The gunmen move through the cinderblock buildings, seizing as hostages other men playing the roles of Israeli soldiers.  
  
Michael Milshtein, a retired Israeli colonel who previously led the military intelligence department overseeing the Palestinian territories, said he was aware of the Hamas videos, but he was still caught off guard by the ambition and scale of Saturday’s attack.  
  
“We knew about the drones, we knew about booby traps, we knew about cyberattacks and the marine forces. … The surprise was the coordination between all those systems,” Milshtein said.  
  
The seeds of Israel’s failure to anticipate and stop Saturday’s attack go back at least a decade. Faced with recurring attacks from Hamas militants tunneling under Israel’s border fence, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed a very concrete solution — build a bigger wall.  
  
With financial help from U.S. taxpayers, Israel completed construction of a $1.1-billion project to fortify its existing defenses along its 40-mile land border with Gaza in 2021. The new, upgraded barrier includes a “smart fence” up to 20 feet tall, festooned with cameras that can see in the dark, razor wire and seismic sensors capable of detecting the digging of tunnels more than 200 feet below. Manned guard posts were replaced with concrete towers topped with remote-controlled machine guns.  
  
“In our neighborhood, we need to protect ourselves from wild beasts,” Netanyahu said in 2016, referring to Palestinians and neighboring Arab states. “At the end of the day, as I see it, there will be a fence like this one surrounding Israel in its entirety.”  
  
Shortly after dawn Saturday, Hamas fighters pushed through Netanyahu’s wall in a matter of minutes. And they did it relatively on the cheap, using explosive charges to blow holes in the barrier and then sending in bulldozers to widen the breaches as fighters streamed through on motorcycles and in pickup trucks. Cameras and communications gear were bombarded by off-the-shelf commercial drones adapted to drop hand grenades and mortar shells — a tactic borrowed directly from the battlefields of Ukraine.  
  
Snipers took out Israel’s sophisticated robo-guns by targeting their exposed ammunition boxes, causing them to explode. Militants armed with assault rifles sailed over the Israeli defenses slung under paragliders, providing Hamas airborne troops despite lacking airplanes. Increasingly sophisticated homemade rockets, capable of striking Tel Aviv, substituted for a lack of heavy artillery.  
  
Satellite images analyzed by the AP show the massive extent of the damage at the heavily fortified Erez border crossing between Gaza and Israel. The images taken Sunday and analyzed Tuesday showed gaping holes in three sections of the border wall, the largest more than 230 feet wide.  
  
Once the wall was breached, Hamas fighters streamed through by the hundreds. A video showed a lone Israeli battle tank rushing to the site of the attack, only to be attacked and quickly destroyed in a ball of flame. Hamas then disabled radio towers and radar sites, likely impeding the ability of the Israeli commanders to see and understand the extent of the attack.  
  
They then fanned out across the countryside of southern Israel, attacking kibbutzim and a music festival. On the bodies of some of the Hamas militants killed during the invasion were detailed maps showing planned zones and routes of attack, according to images posted by Israeli first responders who recovered some of the the corpses. Israeli authorities announced Wednesday that they had recovered the bodies of about 1,500 Hamas militants, though no details were provided about where they were found or how they died.  
  
Military experts told the AP the attack showed a level of sophistication not previously exhibited by Hamas, likely suggesting they had external help.  
  
“I just was impressed with Hamas’ ability to use basics and fundamentals to be able to penetrate the wall,” said retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Stephen Danner, a combat engineer trained to build and breach defenses. “They seemed to be able to find those weak spots and penetrate quickly and then exploit that breach.”",13/10/23 17:07:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1773ji4/this_is_bad/,4,15,1165,Oct 2023,top,all
1b4i4f2,What will happen if Israel attacks Rafah and Yahya Sinwar and Israeli hostages are not found ,"What will happen if Israel does invade Rafah which they say they will do as the Ramadan dateline approaches if both sides fail to agree on another round of hostage exchange and a ”pause” / “temporary ceasefire”/ ceasefire….idk what to call it, different people are calling for different demands

Israel has publicly and officially declared two military objectives when they initiated the invasion of Gaza last year in 2023, and has been repeating the same military objectives throughout this military operation. The two published military objectives as follows:

1. Secure the release of all the Israeli and foreign hostages. There are about 130+ hostages still held by Hamas and other armed groups. 

2. Destruction of Hamas (not the Hamas ideology, but the current leadership of Hamas, especially those Hamas leaders in Gaza who were behind the Oct 7th terror attacks on Israell.

At this moment, there is no clear idea how to evacuate the civilians out of Rafah to try to minimize Gazan civilian casualties. It’ssimply  not clear, some even doubt that it can actually be done. 

My questions are:

1. What will happen once Israel attacks Rafah and Yahya Sinwar and other Hamas leaders could not be found ? If they cant be found, captured or arrested in Rafah, where are they hiding ? Not saying they will be found in a few days immediately after Rafah’s invasion. But after a few weeks and at most a month, it should be reasonable to expect IDF needs to show something. Where could they be ? Where is Yahya Sinwar ? rafah is about 25 sqm2, that. Is the size of manhattan island.

What’s next ? There are no other major Gaza cities in Gaza. Could the Hamas leaders have been smuggled out via the many smuggling underground tunnels in Gaza.

2. What will happen once Israel attacks Rafah and the 130+ hostages could not be found ? What’s next ? Where could they be held ? Are they even still alive ?

19dgy1n,Israeli Rhetoric,"Genocide requires intent and obviously over these last few months the statements made by Israeli officials are used to try and show the intent is there. I could go on for a while sharing the dehumanizing statements made by officials but im not going to do that I think we all get the point by now. If we look at history dehumanizing the enemy is fairly common but it has faded away from the public eye and is instead said behind closed doors. I don't believe humans naturally want to kill another human in the civilized world so part of convincing a military force to fight and kill is by taking the human out of the human. While the things said by Israeli officials are shocking the things said behind closed doors amongst members of a military would make thier statements look like a picnic. The difference between Hamas and the IDF is that the IDF has measures to prevent these things from happening and punish those who commit them Hamas does not instead they reward them this is shown by the pay to slay policy. While there is no ""good"" in war it is human nature to forget the ""good"" that is being done and focus on the bad. With an organization as large as the IDF and with the build up of hate over the years there is bound to be bad apples it's not avoidable. The Israelis are angry and rightfully so and have made clear mistakes such as shutting off the water on October 7th but on oct 15 they claimed to have turned it back on. This was before the invasion took place on Oct 27. Statements have been made out of anger as well as actions but I truly don't believe it represents the true intentions of Israel. There are things that could clearly be done better on the isreali side but war is logistically complex with the added risk factor of combat. To defend the aid which hamas has been seen stealing troops may need to be taken from high intensity combat zones which risk the effectiveness of the operation and risk larger combat flare ups in safer regions. War is all bad and with the small heavily urban area of gaza it makes it much more difficult.

17bx5mb,"New Analysis Report on Israel-Hamas Humanitarian Logistics (Gaza, 20 Oct 2023)","**New Analysis Report on Israel-Hamas Conflict & Humanitarian Logistics (Gaza, 20 Oct 2023)**

Hey everyone, our team at the HADR Institute just dropped a comprehensive analysis on the current humanitarian logistics in the midst of the Israel-Hamas conflict. We understand this is a challenging and complex situation, our organisation as an NGO aims to provide credible information. This is almost impossible to do in this context, however we are transparent in our methodology and use of open sources to enable research.  


**Aa quick summary:**

* **Overview**: Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, there have been significant disruptions to the pivotal humanitarian transportation and logistics networks in Gaza. Key challenges include roadblocks, airstrikes, and halted operations at essential crossings, which have greatly impacted aid delivery. Our report provides a comprehensive assessment of the current landscape.
* **Key Questions**: how exactly is the humanitarian logistics network in Gaza been affected?
* **Primary Indicators Examined**:

1. The condition and accessibility of humanitarian zones, roads, airports, and ports.
2. Potential safety hazards or security risks impeding movement.  


**Some key findings.**  
Amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, Gaza is grappling with significant humanitarian logistical issues:  
  
**Humanitarian Zones:** The designated aid area in Al-Mawasi requires a secure corridor from the Rafah border, which is yet to be established.  
  
**Road Conditions:** Due to ongoing disruptions from Hamas roadblocks and Israeli airstrikes, road infrastructure might deteriorate further. Israeli access points for humanitarian supplies are not anticipated to open soon.  
  
**Air and Maritime Access:** Gaza's non-operational airports, combined with Israel's maritime blockade, obstruct both aerial and maritime aid deliveries.  
  
**Security Risks:** Humanitarian convoys are at an increased risk of theft, collateral damage, and direct attacks.  
  
**Misuse of Aid:** There are ongoing concerns about the misuse of aid, particularly items that could have dual purposes.

""Hamas is backed by a political force that provides Hamas weapons, war strategies and tactics, other supplies, etc. Hamas' strategies will be: 

Step 1 - to lure the Israeli army to enter the ground of Gaza; Hamas has already planted a large number of unprecedented weapons of mass destruction in the ground, especially remote-controlled super bombs, which have been planted in advance. It will bring massive casualties to the Israeli army. 

Step 2 - If the Israeli army enters Gaza, there will be a huge amount of weapons never seen before fired at Israel from the Golan Heights. The main target will be energy facilities and other important facilities in Israel. 

Step 3 - At the same time, from the direction of Egypt, the already placed unconventional weapons and death squads will directly attack Israel's mainland. In key areas, suicide bombers will be used. 

Step 4: if the above events occur, the Israeli army will suffer a heavy loss, and Britain and the United States may intervene in the war. Regardless of whether they do or not, the war will have just begun. After which, Hamas will use novel ways and novel weapons to combat.""

I don't think Gaza had electricity when they were told to not evacuate, so it would probably have been by analogue means. Did they yell from mosques? I guess it's not that strange that I can't find any recordings of it.

So, has anyone found anything on the counter-evacuation orders that I haven't?

Paper claims that Hamas is shorting Israeli ETF (Exchange Traded Funds and IL Companies listed in US) stocks by waging war with Israel.If war breaks out, Israeli stock prices do down, Hamas et al shorts on this stock and makes the spread difference. Its huge profit making business.

The Short volume spiked to over 200,000 shares! Thats a crazy amount, and 100% of the trading volume in EIS on OCT 2nd. Data is obtained by FINRA. Study insights on Short Volume, Securities Lending Utilization and a 52 week Placebo test.

Apparently Hamas planned this attack initially on April 5th 2023. (passover), cancelled after Israel raised its terror alert. 

Theres also growth of the short interest leading to Oct 7th; and the options expiring primarily at Oct 13th. Open Interest increased sharply after the attacks.

178yrc3,"Let Us, this world of Nations, evacuate and re-patriate the Palestinians to other countries.","Two million Palestinian refugees. That is a reasonable amount of people that can be evacuated, removed, from Gaza and granted asylum thru-out the world. Dozens of countries would be willing to grant fresh starts.

The Palestinians lost this long struggle. Now remove them from Israel's land and disperse them elsewhere to start anew. It seems apparent that some minority of the Palestinian population will forever be bitter to the point of murdering children and such. I propose that the only way to never have a repetition of bloodshed from Gaza, is to remove the whole population. At this moment, Oct 15, 2023, the entire population has been ordered to the southern portion of Gaza, in preparation for the IDF invasion.  Are we seriously to believe there will be ANYTHING left standing in that whole half of Gaza? It will be reduced to rubble in short order. Can you picture in your minds all the demolished buildings in the backdrop as the IDF finally walks away saying ""Later Losers, ya'll be good"". Where will anyone house themselves when this is all over? 

I believe the IDF could change direction completely from that of an invasion to that of an filtration and exportation of the Palestinian population. Then claim all of Gaza for Israel.

Benjamin Netanhyahu. PM of Israel: Bolster Hamas and Transfer Money to Them to Thwart Palestinian State (2019) “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,” he told a meeting of his Likud party’s Knesset members in March 2019. “This is part of our strategy – to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.”

Bezalel Smotrich, leader of Israel’s Religious Zionist Party:

On the international playing field, in this game of the delegitimization think about for a second, the P.A. is a liability and Hamas is an asset. It’s a terrorist organization. Nobody will recognize it, nobody will give it status at the ICC and nobody will let them push resolutions at the UN and they’ll need an American veto or we won’t need one.  
  
I’m not sure at all that given the current situation given the current facts that the central playing field we’re playing in is international there Abu Mazen (Abbas) is costing us serious casualties and Hamas in such a situation would be an asset. I don’t think we need to be afraid of that \[Hamas taking over\].

Israel gave major aid to Hamas (2001)  
Israel and Hamas may currently be locked in deadly combat, but, according to several current and former U.S. intelligence officials, beginning in the late 1970s, Tel Aviv gave direct and indirect financial aid to Hamas over a period of years.  
  
Even then, some in Israel saw some benefits to be had in trying to continue to give Hamas support: ""The thinking on the part of some of the right-wing Israeli establishment was that Hamas and the other groups, if they gained control, would refuse to have anything to do with the pace process and would torpedo any agreements put in place,"" said a U.S. government official.

189t7vl,"Hamas is an obstacle, so is the Israeli government","I’ve read a lot of posts in this sub, and from what I understand people are quite polarized on the matter of the roots of the conflict, so I won’t dive into that. You can believe whatever you want, but let’s not ignore the facts on the ground.

I’ll start by saying I agree that Hamas is a huge obstacle in front of a possible peace. Their ways and ideology only deepens the conflict, and it’s only logical Israel is acting against them after what happened in Oct. 7th. But I refuse the idea that Israel is a bastion of peace in this conflict.

Let’s look at the West Bank, where there is no Hamas government. According to U.N, [700000 Israeli settlers are living illegally in the occupied areas.](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/human-rights-council-hears-that-700000-israeli-settlers-are-living-illegally-in-the-occupied-west-bank-meeting-summary-excerpts/) [Government have lit the green light for even more settlements in the area](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-advances-plans-for-5700-settlement-homes-breaking-annual-record-in-6-months/), which are regarded as illegal and an obstacle against a possible peace by both the U.N and U.S. Remember that these settlements are build in the lands belonging to Palestinians. This is obvious settler colonialism.

Add on top of that the countless raids, arrests and killings by the IDF, which are unnecessarily violent most of the time. Dozens of children are being [killed](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/28/west-bank-spike-israeli-killings-palestinian-children) and [arrested](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/07/19/israel-security-forces-abuse-palestinian-children) by the IDF every year. I highly recommend you to watch the documentary [“Five Broken Cameras”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZQap909uQg) to better understand the treatment of IDF against Palestinians. I’m sure most of you have seen at least one report about IDF shooting civilians without having any accountability to this date.

Now, peace? Tell that to the farmer whom Israel stole his land to settle it’s own people. Tell that to the mother whom children were unjustifiably killed by the IDF. Many people in Palestine know at least one relative that was killed by the IDF. Tell that to them.

And lastly, Gaza. I’ll never support what Israel is doing in Gaza. I’m sick of seeing dead bodies of the babies that were killed in the bombings. I’m sick of seeing the inhumane conditions Gazans are pushed into. One of the most advanced armies in the world must do better than carpet bombing the entire region. [Even the U.S says so.](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/renewed-gaza-fighting-stretches-into-second-day-after-israel-hamas-truce-2023-12-01/) The civilian death toll in Gaza already surpassed Ukraine, just in 2 months. 

I feel the pain of Israelis. I can understand their motives when defending the war. But please, try to see, this is not a war to stop the conflict. Killing 15000 civilians doesn’t end the conflict. Look what happened in Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan. The more Israel crushes upon innocent Palestinians, the more will the conflict deepen.",03/12/23 13:12:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/189t7vl/hamas_is_an_obstacle_so_is_the_israeli_government/,0,39,433,Oct 2023,top,all

This strategy seems to have the intention of allowing Netanyahu, and Israel, to contine their military build up and to prevent any chance of a Palestinian state under the guise of ""but what about Hamas they want to destroy us and they don't want a two state solution"". In 2019 Netanyahu said: “Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas … This is part of our strategy – to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.”

Hamas not wanting a two state solution? Hmmmm, now who else's interest might that be in? Let me break it to you - Netanyahu's and Israel's.

18ea8ft,My opinion on the inhuman plan of Israel gor palestinian,"
In this article, the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence is revealed to recommend the forcible and permanent transfer of Gaza Strip's 2.2 million Palestinian residents to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The 10-page document, dated Oct. 13, 2023, suggests this as the preferred course of action in the context of the ongoing conflict. While the document's existence doesn't necessarily imply its adoption, it highlights the official policy discussions around forced population transfer amid a military offensive on Gaza.

The plan proposes evacuating the civilian population to Sinai, establishing tent cities and later permanent ones in northern Sinai, and creating a sterile zone within Egypt to prevent the return of the population to the Gaza-Israel border. The document recommends enlisting international support, particularly from the United States, for this endeavor. It emphasizes the need to mobilize governments worldwide to implement the move.

The article notes the Ministry's confirmation of the document's authenticity and its distribution to the defense establishment, stressing that it was not intended for public disclosure. Despite the Intelligence Ministry's limited direct authority over intelligence bodies, its preparation of such a detailed proposal during a military offensive reflects the seriousness with which forced population transfer is being considered at an official level.

The plan unfolds in stages, including evacuating the population southward, focusing airstrikes on northern Gaza, initiating a ground incursion, and simultaneously moving Palestinian civilians into Egyptian territory, preventing their return. The document suggests promoting a campaign targeting Gaza's civilians to motivate them to accept the plan, focusing on the loss of land and asserting that there is no hope of returning to territories soon to be occupied by Israel.

It's essential to highlight the gravity of such a plan, as forced population transfer is deemed a serious war crime under international law. The article underscores that the Ministry's research is not based on military intelligence but serves as a basis for government discussions. The proposed campaign aims to influence Palestinians to give up their land, framing it as a necessity due to Hamas' leadership. The unfolding situation raises concerns about the potential humanitarian and legal implications of implementing such a proposal.
 
So yes it's quite awful to say that most people here continue defends israel and that people will be able to go back to gaza.

First let's start with the IDF losing any source of credibility. Many people love making fun of hamas ministry of health numbers saying how little trust they have in them. Well guess what to the majority of people the IDF numbers and reputation matches Hamas.

Just looks at all these  IDF examples.

I mean the examples goes on and on. It's a shame this sub-redditt doesn't allow videos because the videos I can post about the IDF army and their behavior are countless for any one video you could post , i can provide five its insane. At one point the IDF had this reputation of being a supreme military force that was an envy to other world military forces.  Guess what that's down the drain. The IDF record at fighting in the ground against hamas has been terrible, they basically only have an advantage when it comes to dropping bombs from an airplane to a force that has no air power. Their fighting a military force that is using Soviet era machine guns while they have 21st century armory and have a poor record. Can't tell you how many military podcasts make fun of the ineptitude of the IDF on the ground.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/26/israel-hamas-gaza-military-idf-technology-surveillance-fence-strategy-ground-war/

And what a hungry for blood mentality by israel , I don't see many people on this sub-reddit talk about the embassy bombing in syria. But its hard to even find a modern example of another country attacking an embassy. Under the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic immunity, the premises of a diplomatic mission are inviolable. I mean you can just feel the Telegram of israel wanting iran to retaliate to justify a Lebanese invasion or spreading the war to Iran. If I was a citizen I would be outraged my country is trying to expand the war. But guess what netanyahu is trying his hardest to stay in power and you smucks are happy  letting him play a political game while we're seeing one of the worst modern massacres of our life time. Yes let's tie a war with a politician that's trying to remain in power so he won't go to jail for corruption, I don't see anything wrong with that 

Every single international body, almost every citizen in all countries have been shocked and distrusted by the actions of the IDF and the israel government. The amount of tourists that will go to israel will decrease the amount of citizens leaving the country is also increasing. Honestly seeing a country going from 100 to 0 is quite amazing but somehow israel is doing it. You have support of the U.S government, the president of the united states calls himself a proud zionest and many still pretend that nobody supports israel and you are all being malignant attacked for your religion when infact your actions is what anybody needs to judge you fairly. 

Many comments are going to reply what do you expect a country to do post oct 7, well it's definitely not what been happening for these past 5 month, hopefully countries have a playbook on what not to do by not following this inept country and it's military.

None of this pertains to the history of the conflict, none of this pertains to the recent attacks on and/or following Oct. 7th. These are all just human rights violations Israel has committed after 1967, up to 10/7/23.  
The problem is that there is such an intense information war going on between Western and Eastern forces, everyone has a vested interest in this conflict given it's history and the context by which Israel was born. As well as the geopolitical machinations at work.  
It's impossible to know which side is telling the truth. Israelis say that the Palestinians are all liars an the Palestinians say the same thing about the Israelis.  
Both are or have committed atrocities against innocents, nobody's blameless, from a macro perspective.  
That's why I think a ceasefire is so important. It'll stop the killing and might possibly bring an in impartial body to investigate the claims made, on both sides, and hold the people responsible accountable for the crimes they've committed. If they are both recommended to the ICC. But I don't think it's going to happen.  
Because Israel is culpable for the crimes they've committed before and after Oct 7th and Hamas is responsible for the atrocities they committed on that day.  
No party is morally righteous or justified. It's all just senseless killing and we're all poorer for it.  
Ethnic cleansing can apply to all of the Israelis killed on Oct. 7th, It also applies to all of the Palestinians killed, disproportionately for all the other 365 days of the year over the last, (let's say) 43 years. And all of the inequities perpetrated by the Israelis matter as well. But the main thing to take away form all of this is that, their is no righteous cause here.

I've sighted these articles to demonstrate the point I made above about the information war perpetrated on both sides. If you want to support your claim then you'd be able to after reading all of the links I've provided. I think the up top I do a pretty good job of illustrating Israeli crimes, I think the links below do a pretty good job of discrediting some of the stories that have been told on the Palestinian side. But, to be clear, nobody really knows the truth about which side is in the right, in this conflict. Until we get an impartial body of qualified professionals in to examine the evidence and look at the nature of what started this conflict and happened on the days leading up to, on Oct. 7th, and after Oct. 7th we are not going to know the full story or get the whole picture. In the mean time people are dying. So I personally think it should stop. But I know most pro-Israeli people will disagree, because you think your cause is righteous. I hope I've convinced you otherwise, but I won't hold my breath.

1any75c,Israel’s well-documented history of using human shields & taking and abusing hostages,"There is rich evidence of Israel’s extensive use of human shields. There is, however, very little evidence that Hamas uses human shields. Sure, there is that one NATO ”report” that says they do, but it presents no evidence whatsoever. It’s basically just a political statement from NATO. If we instead look at respected independent, serious, investigations by the UN, Amnesty International, Humans Rights Watch, B’Tselem etcetera, there’s lots and lots of rich high-quality evidence of Israel’s extensive use of human shields, but the same can certainly not be said with respect to Hamas. 


There is rich high-quality evidence that both Israel and Hamas takes hostages. Israel has taken many, many thousands of hostages though, way, way more than Hamas. We also know with certainty that Israel abuses it’s hostages badly, fatally in many cases. It’s not unlikely based on the evidence that Israel treats its hostages even worse than Hamas does.

Why has this rarely been mentioned in Western media until very recently? Why does Israel get away with this stuff?

*** Excerpts from the human shields references above: ***

""The Mission did not find any evidence to support the allegations that hospital facilities were used by the Gaza authorities or by Palestinian armed groups to shield military activities or that ambulances were used to transport combatants or for other military purposes."" ""On the basis of the information it gathered, the Mission found no indication that the civilian population was forced by Hamas or Palestinian armed groups to remain in areas under attack from the Israeli armed forces."" ”The Mission investigated four incidents in which the Israeli armed forces coerced Palestinian civilian men at gunpoint to take part in house searches during the military operations (chap. XIV). The men were blindfolded and handcuffed as they were forced to enter houses ahead of the Israeli soldiers. In one of the incidents, Israeli soldiers repeatedly forced a man to enter a house in which Palestinian combatants were hiding. Published testimonies of Israeli soldiers who took part in the military operations confirm the continuation of this practice, despite clear orders from Israel’s High Court to the armed forces to put an end to it and repeated public assurances from the armed forces that the practice had been discontinued. The Mission concludes that this practice amounts to the use of Palestinian civilians as human shields and is therefore prohibited by international humanitarian law.""

""In several cases Israeli soldiers also used civilians, including children, as “human shields”, endangering their lives by forcing them to remain in or near houses which they took over and used as military positions. Some were forced to carry out dangerous tasks such as inspecting properties or objects suspected of being booby-trapped. Soldiers also took position and launched attacks from and around inhabited houses, exposing local residents to the danger of attacks or of being caught in the crossfire."" ""However, contrary to repeated allegations by Israeli officials of the use of “human shields”, Amnesty International found no evidence that Hamas or other Palestinian fighters directed the movement of civilians to shield military objectives from attacks.""

""Amnesty International […] does not have evidence at this point that Palestinian civilians have been intentionally used by Hamas or Palestinian armed groups during the current hostilities to “shield” specific locations or military personnel or equipment from Israeli attacks.""

""In the killings documented in this report, Human Rights Watch found no evidence that the civilian victims were used by Palestinian fighters as human shields or were shot in the crossfire between opposing forces.""",11/02/24 03:18:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1any75c/israels_welldocumented_history_of_using_human/,0,59,836,Oct 2023,top,all
19eo9zm,"This war has cost Israel it's Image, safety and money","We are 25 days removed from the terrible negligence caused by the IDF army in shooting its own citizens, shooting three individuals who were waving a white flag two of them shot on sight while the third being hunted into a building and shot down. The army said it was their fault and soldiers didn't follow their policy of  ""According to the rules of engagement, soldiers are not supposed to fire when someone has a white flag.”

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/3-israeli-hostages-tried-only-killed-military-rcna130912

Let's go to yesterday where the independent through ITV were interviewing individuals trying to connect to their wives and daughters to evacuate as they were instructed to by the IDF army. These individuals have the majority of their hands up and were trying to help their family evacuate and waving a white. The camera caught one of them being sniped by the IDF military on live camera dying almost instantly and the rest of his family members dragging him away. The IDF doesn't deny it was their sniper that shot the man and only criticized the video being shown was edited to make them look bad. The case at the end of the day is this IDF shoots at citizens waving white flags despite their own policy and international policy. I implore you to click on the link below and watch the video and watch senseless violence be committed there is no other way to frame it.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/palestine-gaza-itv-report-israel-shot-dead-live-tv-b2483877.html

The independent taking up the story and printing it shows a new approach on how international new organizations are finally portraying israel actions. Israel have always carried the benefit of the doubt in previous wars, and was often trusted on how they conducted themselves. This has all but evaporated with israel sending their reserves armies filled with brash young soldiers that are posting videos embarrassing themselves, their parents and their country.  Along with the most far right government collation that is throwing softball for the media to take quotes filled with racist, apartheidic and genocidal intention that even allowed south africa to go the the ICJ because of it. Without these quotes south Africa would have never been able to make a legal case for genocide.

Israel historically conducted themselves in the public must better than this, through social media and the ability to translate Hebrew tweets and videos the full picture of it current state that his made their global image to fall apart and look like a third rate country run by a dictator instead of this beautiful land of heaven, rich and filled with culture and technological innovation. You have birthright visits starting to decrease and immigration out of the country increase showing people not wanting to be involved with these action.

The falling of American global strength comes at a poor time for israel as they no longer have a strong pillar of support to shield them from criticism. This war no longer can benefit israel, they have full control of the area and bombed gaza back to the stone age. They are building buffer zones in gaza to give them more protection and as long as they keep military near the border unlike on oct 7 such a tragedy will never be repeated.  Israel needs to end this war and elect a new leadership to ensure its image and diplomatic relationship especially with the GCC can be resumed and trade would resume as houthis will stop attacking ships which is bleeding israel of it ability to make money. The fact that israel has not declared victory is worrisome and to me a sign that netanyahu and likud are continuing the war for political reasons instead for the safety of its citizens.

1827k5s,Just now Israel attacked a school.,"There was an attack just now on school with causalities.

It’s strange why does the army keep targeting civilians?

This is not the first time as well just some days ago another school was targeted and that school had sheltered kids who either lost their parents or been injured.

This has crossed the grey area and now it has become more evident to everyone beyond any doubt Israel is employing collective punishment tactics.

Even to name it as collective punishment doesn’t merit the gruesome reality which these people are suffering.

How would people in the pro-Israel team feel if the other party could directly target bunkers or refugee areas?

Even the infrastructure in terms of roads has been destroyed.

Do the pro-Israel team not worry that this will just raise the hatred to levels where even Hamas is seen as not enough?

This war has really affected the reputation of Israel. Besides what assurances does the average Palestinian in Gaza have once the hostages are released?

 Not to mention hospitals were hit and targeted or water tankers or roads destroyed or even destroying bakeries or seeds silos.

This is also not the first time that Israel has attacked Gaza in such a relentless way this is only worse than ever before.

Also we shouldn’t forget that there has been over 3,000 arrests in the West Bank since 7th Oct as well as the settlers attacking the Palestanians and other areas being attacked.


There is no more morality.

1burjyt,"The IDF is an incompetent, unprofessional, undisciplined military force that flagrantly ignores inte","In order for the 7 aid workers to be killed, at least one of the following must hold true:

1. There is no communication between drone operators and the command center about aid convoys in general,

2. Some higher ups at the command center does not care about aid convoys in general,

3. A drone operator can go rogue and use 3 missiles against an ""enemy combatant"",

4. The intel they receive is absolutely horrendous and doesn't go through the proper checks, especially with regard to aid workers. 

If any one of these is true, it shows that the IDF is completely incompetent and unprofessional. Remember that we only hear about this incident because the aid workers are not Palestinians, more than 200 aid workers have been killed but we don't hear about them because the MSM trust the IDF to operate in a competent and professional manner, i.e. they believe that the convoys are hijacked by Hamas. This single incident exposes how rotten the IDF is, and how they completely ignore international law on combat.

This is far from the only incident either, there is the [Flour massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour_massacre) where they open fire at a crowd swarming for food, [a journalist](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/07/journalist-issam-abdallah-killed-by-israeli-tank-firing-in-quick-succession) murdered by the IDF tank shell in Lebanon, the murder of 3 Israeli hostages, the [summary execution of 11 unarmed men](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/un-human-rights-office-opt-unlawful-killings-gaza-city), and recently [the murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_David_Ben_Avraham) of a Palestinian who converted to Judaism in the West Bank. Most of the people who engaged in combat unlawfully often get away unpunished anyway, including those that killed the 3 Israeli hostages.

Before Oct 7th, I held the opinion that while there are some trigger-happy reservists, the IDF in general is competent and professional such that they can execute the will of the state (which I wholeheartedly disagree with but that's a separate conversation), but now I do not think so. They are a complete disgrace and rotten and totally unfit to carry out offensive operations in Gaza or the West Bank.",03/04/24 12:38:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1burjyt/the_idf_is_an_incompetent_unprofessional/,0,213,329,Oct 2023,top,all
1an6cjw,October 7 May Be Engineered by Israeli Government,"This idea may sound completely preposterous to you, but please bear with me for a while. I’ve gathered some pieces of evidence that when put together strongly suggest that October 7 was engineered by the Israeli government.

1. **For years, Netanyahu propped up Hamas.** ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/))
2. **Israel Knew Hamas's Attack Plan More Than a Year Ago.** “Israeli officials obtained Hamas's battle plan for the Oct. 7 terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, documents, emails and interviews show.” ([https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html))
3. **Key IDF officer voiced concern about Nova festival, but was told to OK it.** ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/key-idf-officer-reportedly-voiced-concern-about-nova-festival-but-was-told-to-ok-it/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/key-idf-officer-reportedly-voiced-concern-about-nova-festival-but-was-told-to-ok-it/)) “Gaza Division operations officer saw party as ‘needless security risk’ due to proximity to Gaza” “Some 360 people were killed by Hamas terrorists at the rave on October 7, and dozens more were assaulted and taken hostage.”
4. **Four in 10 Palestinian men spend time in Israel jails. Hamas says it wants to exchange captured Israelis for them.** ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/why-are-so-many-palestinian-prisoners-in-israeli-jails](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/why-are-so-many-palestinian-prisoners-in-israeli-jails)) “One in every five Palestinians has been arrested and charged under the 1,600 military orders…. That incarceration rate doubles for Palestinian men — two in every five have been arrested.” “There are 1,264 Palestinian administrative detainees, which means that they are held indefinitely behind bars without facing trial or any charges.” Yet, many Israeli civilians have been killed on October 7. Dead people can’t be used as hostages. So, who killed them?
5. **Of the 1400 “civilians” reported by Israel to have been killed by Hamas, 200 among them were later concluded as not Israelis but Hamas fighters.** ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/10/israel-revises-death-toll-from-october-7-hamas-attack-to-1200-people](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/10/israel-revises-death-toll-from-october-7-hamas-attack-to-1200-people)) Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu admitted in a conversation with anchor Mehdi Hasan on MSNBC that some of the “badly burnt” bodies after the attacks on October 7 were of Hamas fighters. That is why the death toll was revised. ([https://www.facebook.com/dawndotcom/videos/watch-some-of-the-burnt-bodies-from-oct-7-were-hamas-membersmark-regev-an-advise/2004970319878595/](https://www.facebook.com/dawndotcom/videos/watch-some-of-the-burnt-bodies-from-oct-7-were-hamas-membersmark-regev-an-advise/2004970319878595/)) Being that they were “badly burnt” meant that they were killed not by mere guns but powerful weapons. In fact, “According to a police source, an investigation into the incident also revealed that an IDF combat helicopter that arrived at the scene from the Ramat David base fired at the terrorists and apparently also hit some of the revelers who were there.” (Translated by Google Translate from [https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2023-11-18/ty-article/0000018b-e1a5-d168-a3ef-f5ff4d070000](https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2023-11-18/ty-article/0000018b-e1a5-d168-a3ef-f5ff4d070000), English report here: Israel admits it killed its own at Nova music festival: [https://thecradle.co/articles-id/13111](https://thecradle.co/articles-id/13111))
6. Now, you may wonder: How could the soldiers in that IDF combat helicopter be so confused as to attack and kill its own civilians among Hamas fighters? It may not be a case of confusion, but deliberateness. For this, we need to understand **the “Hannibal Directive”**. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/3/whats-the-hannibal-directive-a-former-israeli-soldier-tells-all](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/3/whats-the-hannibal-directive-a-former-israeli-soldier-tells-all)) It “is an Israeli military policy that stipulates the use of maximum force in the event of a soldier being kidnapped … the use of force is carried out even at the risk of killing a captive soldier.” It may be that the directive was also applied to civilians on October 7.

When we put together all the above evidence and logical reasoning, it seems likely that October 7 was engineered by the Israeli government. With that, the government can invade Gaza with the excuse “Israel has the right to defend itself.”",10/02/24 03:03:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1an6cjw/october_7_may_be_engineered_by_israeli_government/,0,56,522,Oct 2023,top,all

I've also read that Israel should shut Iron Dome down for the fight to be fair?

I think it's pretty self-explanatory why this reasoning is bullshit, but I will do so anyway, because people seriously appear to believe it

A) Israel has the Iron Dome, because  it uses its aid to invest in self-defense. Gaza does not have Iron dome  because it doesn't invest in self-defense, only in weapons and terror  tunnels

B) Iron Dome only has a 90-95% success rate, which amounted to 12 peope killed, and 114 people injured in May 2021 alone.

C)  Operating Iron Dome is not exactely cheap. Israel is dedicating a  significant amount of its budget to it, which they could better spend  elsewhere, but can't.

D) Iron Dome  doesn't protect from psychological damage. 50% of kids in SOuthern  Israel have PTSD, depression and miscarriages are also high.

E) A war is not a sport where every time needs to be subjected to the same rules. Every country is entitled to using the advantages it has. This is especially true for a victim like Israel that is only defending itself.

An open border to Egypt could be a wide, open door for trade and help to fuel an environment in which people live and work harmoniously, thus contributing to greater creativity and security.

What happened on october 7th was abhorrent and completely reprehensible. That being said, what happened afterwards in gaza is a huge stain on humanity.

I mean the very least they could do is stop the indiscriminate bombing of civilians. If there was a hamas operative in tel aviv, would they pulverize the city and claim victory when they killed that operative (+dozens of children)?  

I've seen so many videos of literal children, infants, babies, all covered in blood screaming for help. I have never seen a more haunting thing ever, and for the palestinians on the ground they have been forced to go through with this every hour of the day. I can choose to turn off my phone, to not watch those videos, but for them these things are happening in front of them. Their children are dying questioning what's going on, asking where their parents are, one even asked the doctor if he was dead! A child!  

There is nothing which can justify this. Israel is probably the most well equiped country in the world to deal with hamas, and it is extremely out of the ordinary for such a huge intelligence failure to occur especially on a holiday where they should be on high alert! It can easily have prevented this, even egypt warned them 3 days earlier, and the whole army took 6 hrs to even intervene after the event! Israel can easily defend against hamas if it wishes to do so.

Hamas is a plague on gaza, and only makes the situation worse. But the answer to that plague is not murdering a journalists family as he was broadcasting live. The answer is not to bomb ambulances and people leaving the hospital. The answer is not to completely pulverize a refugee camp to get a few hamas operatives.

I constantly have to reassure people I don’t support Israel so they won’t hate me, but they still do anyway

The worst part is, my family is directly involved with this conflict. They live in the closest city to the border of where the Gaza Strip is and their city has been under fire for years as well. I remember being on Skype calls with my grandparents who are old and disabled, and they had to rush out of the building because of bomb threats and it was really scary. My dad was visiting them right before the first attack happened. He was planning to go to that festival with my aunt, but because she caught Covid they didn’t end up going and he left and came home early, taking a flight 30 mins before Hamas invaded… my aunt, cousins, grandparents and more family are still there and were sheltering in place at the time and scared us when they went MIA for a while... I had told my friends I’m really worried for my family because they were MIA but I’m glad my dad was okay and able to leave on time… and they called me privileged since “Gazan citizens don’t have the right to leave”. I KNOW that people don’t have that right, one of my cousins who did go to the festival and another family friend has already died, people who I loved and grew up with, but people refuse to see this side of the conflict. These “friends” blocked me on social media after that. How am I supposed to support a state that’s literally killing my family? I know that what Israel is doing is completely wrong and over the top, I hate Netanyahu and the government of Israel. But I can’t help but feel extremely worried over the safety of my family and my people. Does that make me evil?

Israel was the only safe place for my family to move to during the holocaust. Most of my great grandparents on both sides were victims. They were captured and taken to the camps, and never heard from again. Because of Israel, my parents were able to grow up in a safe place and could have me. 
I really want to see the other side because I feel completely hated and wrong for still liking Israel… but I really can’t help it. The thing about Israelis is that they don’t take shit anymore. After the holocaust, they realized they’re the only ones who can defend themselves and that’s what they’re doing, hitting back a million times harder.. but I know that doesn’t make it right, but the Jewish people deserve to have a safe home after so many centuries of antisemitism and constantly attacked. Plus, Israel has offered so much technical and medical innovation to the world and provide a lot of development. My thoughts are telling me I’m wrong and evil but my heart still can’t find a way to completely denounce Israel. My brain constantly fights with itself as I always go back and forth as you can probably tell in this messy post lol, and I know if I wasn’t Israeli I’d also hate Israel as a left-leaning person. Everyone I talk to about this results to insults and never tries to understand me or give me good reasoning to change my views.

gql96u,Israel has a moral obligation to resolve conflict,"Full disclosure: I grew up as a Palestinian refugee in Lebanon so naturally my views are influenced by that. With that said, here is some points that I'd like to see addressed. These are not necessarily cohesive and do not follow any logical progression.   
\- Palestinians were/are a disenfranchised people and any attempt to hold them accountable for previous/current irrational behaviour that doesn't consider this is disingenuous and frustrating. 

\- Palestinians were (and likely still) an ignorant population that lack any real representation. This doesn't absolve them from responsibility for themselves but it does not mean they are not victims.   
\- The conflict has never been a symmetric one. From a Palestinian point of view, Israelis are absolutely colonizers.   
\- Here is shocker! Zionism is logical and warranted! I empathize and understand the Jewish struggle for a national homeland. However, Zionists should acknowledge the absolutely devastating impact of their project on the inhabitants of the land and should make amends for it.   
\- Palestinians have a distinct national identity. Any argument against this is disingenuous. After 70+ years in Lebanon for example, we still have a recognizably distinct dialect/customs/food. Simple example is Palestinian wedding songs/traditions.   
\- Politically, Palestinians are dumb as a rock but this again needs to be put into context of earlier points (disenfranchisement, lack of representation but also lack of human development).   
\- Arabs =/= Palestinians in terms of decision making. Palestinians (as people) were not part of the decision to reject the partition plan or launch a war against Israel in 48 or 67. Arabs have made terrible decisions on our behalf and now are fed up   
\- Palestinians did not really have any real agency until the emergence of Yasser Arafat/PLO. Realistically, we still do not have   
\- Palestinians who are materially distant from the Palestinian struggle have an irrational, romantacized and fatalistic view of the conflict. 

Here is a personal review of their history of the conflict as it relates to my family (based on my interrogation of now deceased grandparents) 

\- Grandparents on both side are from the village of Lubya  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubya) 

\- Grandparents were simple farmers with a ingrained connection to the village. I am talking folksy songs, sayings and customs that pertain to the town.    
\- Grandparents were expelled from their village under ""Israeli"" bombardment. This is actually only documented in Israeli sources since the villagers were mostly simple illiterate people. Overall, Palestinian history is not at all well documented (note this doesn't mean it isn't true). 

\- Grandparents and their descendants are still mostly disenfranchised refugees in Lebanon. 

\- Grandparents are their descendants are victims. 

\- If my  family has come from a different part of the middle east before then neither I nor my grandparents know where that would be. Genuinely only know that the ancestors that we can trace were born/have lived as farmers in this village. 

I would like to know who is responsible for our continued suffering? 

\- I personally hold Israel responsible for the creation of our problem and would like for Israel to acknowledge that. 

\- I hold Arabs responsible for extending our suffering and our of lack of human development. I would actually like for Arabs to move past the Palestinian the issue and focus on their own development. 

\- I also hold us (Palestinians) responsible for still not getting our shit together and being more pragmatic. However, I think we keep getting dealt a losing hand. We have tried many avenues (including some genuine attempts to resolving the conflict peacefully) but to no avail. 

\- I think Israel does not have a genuine interest in resolving the conflict since the status quo is favourable to Israel.  

\- I also think what Israeli have done to build a country from nothing and what they continue to achieve is beyond impressive. 

\- As I said, this is not a symmetric conflict. Israel is the only party that can actually resolve the conflict. This combined with their responsibility for creating our suffering means they have a moral obligation to resolve this issue. 

\- I think the Palestinian mantra of ""from the river to the sea"" is empty rhetoric. Palestinian will accept any resolution that allows to them to express their national identity and gives them a fair chance to build a life somewhere they truly belong. However, this must include the refugees. 

I think the following is fair feasible plan to resolve the conflict: 

\- Israel offers a token apology for the  plight of Palestinians. 

\- Israel annexes West Bank and Gaza and create an autonomous demilitarized Palestinian state/""federality"". 

\- Israel grants citizenship to all current resident of West Bank and Gaza as well as all refugees and their descendants. However, residency is limited to the Palestinian state. 

\- All matters of defense/foreign relations/trade to be under control of Israeli legislature. 

\- Palestinians should have limited representation in Israeli legislature. 

\- Limited migration in and out of Palestinian state to be allowed based on strict quotas and in a time diluted manner. All subject to Israeli legislature approval.",25/05/20 22:58:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/gql96u/israel_has_a_moral_obligation_to_resolve_conflict/,134,177,843,Gaza,top,all

18it9nj,I used to support Israel until...,"I'm a secular Jew. My mother is a German jew my father is a Mexican Jew (cue self-hating jew accusations). We were never religious. I'm pretty sure I've only been to Temple a few times when I was a kid. I've been to Israel once when I was a baby, but I don't remember much of it. My mother insisted on going. My older sister remembers more of it than I do, and my younger sisters weren't even born yet.

For the longest time, my parents always said to me that Israel was the only democracy in the Middle East and a beacon for us and that if things ever got bad in America, we could always go there. I really believed it for the longest time. I was aware of the Palestinian conflict, but I literally just thought it was a bunch of angry terrorists pestering the government. 

That was until I was a sophomore in high school when not I was showing the documentary Death in Gaza and I saw how Gazans lived under the blockade and how the cameraman James Miller was killed by an IDF soldier and the IDF attempted to cover it up and the soldier in question was never punished. I expected to see this kind of behavior from an American police department, not Israel. In the documentary, they showed footage of a 12 year old getting shot by an Israeli tank for throwing stone. I remember getting in trouble for throwing a stone at 10 and scratching a car. To think I could get shot for that if I was in Gaza

That really set me down a research rabbit hole. I researched life in the West Bank, the settlements. Israeli settlers Mass evicting Palestinians from their homes and acting violently with impunity. One image that really stuck with me was a video of IDF soldiers tear gassing children on their way to school. What kind of cowards do you have to be to be afraid of school children? 

Safe to say, my parents weren't exactly pleased with my change of opinion on Israel. We had a lot of fights about it. But we do have some points of agreement. My parents have no love for Netanyahu, and they think the settlements are irredentist BS that make things worse. My dad blames Netanyahu for sabotaging the Oslo Accords and the assassination of Yitzhak Rabeen. 

Over time, I researched more about open-air prisons where children were kept. I got in touch with Palestinians through my college who had family who still lived there and who have lost family and friends in conflicts. It wasn't until this year that my parents and most of my family lost faith in Israel.

When Netanyahu tried to strangle Israeli democracy itself and turn Israel into what Orban did to Hungry or what PIS did to Poland. Over time, parents have become more aware of Israel's human rights abuses. My parents and even my Bubbie felt completely disillusioned. When October 7th happened, everyone in including me was horrified. I have never had love for Hamas and other terrorist organizations. I personally feel like Palestinian leaders have failed their people time and time again and that Hamas should be wiped out.

After seeing what's going on in Gaza today, I can not, in good faith, support a government that claims to represent all Jews.

Edit to clear things up: Israel has the right to exist given the hundreds of years of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust.  If that makes me a Zionist so be it, but I am no way happy with the way things are run at the moment.

 There's some misconceptions that the documentary convinced me of everything. The documentary opened my eyes to the problems that were already there it was other research and other incidents of power abuse that changed my opinion.",15/12/23 05:58:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18it9nj/i_used_to_support_israel_until/,127,823,645,Gaza,top,all

178b4fr,why is the left is that delusional,"the reason Israel was founded was so there would be a country that would take the Jews and there would be somewhere to go in case of something like the events in WW2.

now when we see some leftist say  why do the Jews need their own state they stole land and so on  meanwhile in Germany they  marking the houses of Jews (1930's anybody?) in Australia people chanting ""gas the Jews"" in France synagogues going into lock down and all over the west universities students and leftists chant ""from the river to the sea"" meaning kill all the Jews in Israel.

and then when we start a military operation too solve the problem in less than a week they're already more concern about the Palestinians.

Hamas is the ruling government of Gaza its not occupied by Israel so when leftist cry war crimes while ignoring that to the international law Hamas counts as government so these statues apply:

ICC Statute Pursuant to Article 8(2)(b)(xxiii) of the 1998 ICC Statute, “utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations” constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts

Article 28 - Treatment II. Danger zones

The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, **(meaning if the use of human shields is a war crime)**

Article 29 - Treatment III. Responsibilities

The Party to the conflict in whose hands protected persons may be, is responsible for the treatment accorded to them by its agents, irrespective of any individual responsibility which may be incurred **(if you do something that would get your civilians in danger if they are killed the other side didn't commit a war crime you did)**

Article 23 - Security of prisoners

No prisoner of war may at any time be sent to, or detained in areas where he may be exposed to the fire of the combat zone, nor may his presence be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.Prisoners of war shall have shelters against air bombardment and other hazards of war, to the same extent as the local civilian population. With the exception of those engaged in the protection of their quarters against the aforesaid hazards, they may enter such shelters as soon as possible after the giving of the alarm. Any other protective measure taken in favour of the population shall also apply to them.Detaining Powers shall give the Powers concerned, through the intermediary of the Protecting Powers, all useful information regarding the geographical location of prisoner of war camps.Whenever military considerations permit, prisoner of war camps shall be indicated in the day-time by the letters PW or PG, placed so as to be clearly visible from the air. The Powers concerned may, however, agree upon any other system of marking. Only prisoner of war camps shall be marked as such.

Article 53 - Prohibited destruction

Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations. **(meaning if you make a civil property  a weapon depot its fair game)**

Article 51 - Protection of the civilian population

1 the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against dangers   arising from military operations. To give effect to this protection, the following rules, which are additional to other applicable rules of international law, shall be observed in all circumstances.

2 The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited. **(Hamas attack anybody)**

4 Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are:

(a) those which are not directed at a specific military objective; **(if its a weapon depot its not indiscriminate)**

7 The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favor or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations. **(Really try justify Hamas here)**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

and then when Israel is forced to do arguably dubious things (according to article 51 and 57) every body cries war crimes and calls Hamas resistance fighters i don't get it if they are ""freedom fighters"" they get to do war crimes the blatant antisemitism is astonishing you want to complain about war crimes call out both sides you don't get to pick and chose.

but that is also the point Israel has the right to defend it self and when Hamas uses civilian population as human shields it forces their hand are you seriously saying that Israel should not respond let me tell you if **any other government was in a similar situation they would respond in the same way.**

17makkz,Social media has brought out the worst in everyone,"Look, I'm not Palestinian, I'm not Jewish. I'm just some person who's watched this situation unfold. Unfortunately, I think it's ripped open all the unhealed wounds of the past, and *everyone* is out for blood.

I've seen people parroting age-old antisemitic tropes, even as they claim they're ""Anti-Zionist"" or ""Anti-Isreal"" and don't have anything against Jews. In America, Jews no longer feel safe on college campuses. In France, the Star of David was spray-painted on municipal buildings, recalling the pogroms from the 1930s. At the Russian airport, there were people literally calling for blood. For death. And that's not even mentioning the horrid, barbarous acts of violence that were committed against innocent Israelis on 10/7.

I've seen horrible callousness toward the innocent civilians in Gaza, including acts of violence and pure hatred toward Palestinians abroad -- not Hamas, but Palestinians. I, like everyone else, see the disturbing photos coming out of Gaza and can't help but feel that wrenching horror in my chest for what innocent men, women, and children are experiencing. A child was murdered in the US, stabbed to death. There are calls to ""glass"" the Palestinians.

I can't help but think that social media has poured gasoline on this fire. Everything has become a trendy debate, a new hashtag. Everyone has a cause now, and they lunge at each other's necks trying to ""win"" the debate, trying to demolish their invisible opponent. Everyone comes locked and loaded with news articles and Twitter posts and YouTube videos, showing *their* side is right, that *they* are the correct ones. And, most of all, each side has their own unique way of saying ""I'm so sorry about your civilians that have been killed BUT mine are more important to consider.""

It's left me listless and detached. It seems that nuance has left the chat, and here we are, going at each other, reviving prejudices, unleashing new ones, because, with social media, it's not about being finding common truth and hearing perspectives, it's about *winning*, at any cost, even if that cost is shedding your humanity in the process.

I feel like an old man screaming at a cloud, even though I'm in my mid-20s, but there is something so shallow about how we leverage social media to discuss these issues. We check our compassion at the door and trade it in for fancy IG stories and Twitter hashtags. We make 60 second TikTok videos where we don't acknowledge the other side's points or feelings, but rather make them out to be the *enemy*\*,\* someone to demolish, someone to destroy. We dox people we don't agree with, we get them fired from their jobs, and in turn they become more radicalized in their opinion. They retreat further into their bubble, and they continue the cycle.

Both sides have their points. I can't imagine the anger and fury and pain Israelis feel after 10/7. I know that Hamas is not an entity that can be reasoned with, who will break any treaty that's brokered because they are not interested in any solution beyond the eradication of Israel and Jews. I could never imagine what people in Gaza experience as bombs rain down on their home and their ""government"" does nothing to help them -- but, rather, steals their water pipes to make more rockets. I can't imagine how infuriating it is to see history repeating itself, with aggression and violence and, likely winnowing their borders, to see world governments aligning yet again with Israel while they are left out in the cold with no food, water, or medicine.

This is war. I won't pretend there's an easy solution. But it's been so demoralizing to watch everyone shed their humanity like a second skin.

o2i43g,we must start to put pressure on the palestinians,"There's a huge dogma in international circles that to solve the conflict, we must put pressure on the Israeli side. Israel is the most powerful side with all the leverage, the argument goes, and she is way too comfortable administering the occupation and upholding the status quo. Only with substantial pressure, possibly sanctions, will we compel Israel to make the compromises necessary for peace. 

However, this dogma has failed for the past decades and indeed is only exacerbating the conflict. This was even the case under the pervasive Arab boycott, at a time Israel was much weaker, and we will probably never see any similar campaigns towards Israel. Israel is now stronger than ever both economically, militarily, and diplomatically. No feasible amount of pressure will make Israel compromise on key issues of national interest and security like Palestinian right of return or disengagement from the settlements. After Gaza, ethnically cleansing 700'000 Jews out of the West Bank and East Jerusalem is a complete non-starter. As is RoR, which would make Jews a minority in Israel. 

Evacuating 8000 settlers in Gaza was extremely controversial and created huge rifts in Israeli society, so evacuating hundreds of thousands of settlers from the West Bank wouldn't be politically attainable. Many of these are deeply ideological and might take up arms, certainly not willingly emigrate. The West Bank account for around the same proportion of Israel's population as California does to the US. The US would never uproot every city in California, even if there was international pressure to return California to Mexico, the ""rightful owner"". This is not even considering the cultural value the West Bank has as the cradle of Jewish civilisation as well as the military and strategic value (the majority of Israel's population lives within 20 km from the Green Line, and the West Bank is very hilly).

Israel is currently under an umbrella, uncertain whether it is still raining. In such a situation, it is highly preferable to keep the umbrella rather than removing it and take the chance that the rain truly has stopped. I understand how Westerners with no skin in the game are inclined to make this gamble with Jewish lives. But to expect Israel to do so is absurd. Previous acts of disengagement resulting in rockets the very same day and the subsequent election of Hamas, the current opinion polls where Hamas is soaring, and PA's continued pay-to-slay programme, have not created the goodwill necessary to make Israel inclined to make concessions they don't need to.

But as long as the West keeps these pipe dreams alive for Palestinians, it makes negotiations completely intractable and only exacerbates the conflict. The only realistic way towards a solution is by Palestinians acknowledging defeat and starting to negotiate terms of surrender. This is how every other conflict with a huge power discrepancy has ended, such as after WW2. In hindsight, the negotiations with Japan and Germany are regarded as huge successes, where both Japan and West Germany quickly became prosperous liberal democracies. Is it ultimately unfair that ethnically cleansed Sudeten Germans weren't allowed to return to Czechoslovakia and those who remained were expelled? Perhaps, but nobody is claiming today that their descendants have the right to return now, and most people would agree that it would be foolish for Germany to reject the post-war deals on the basis of an inequitable solution for Sudeten Germans. Of course they are entitled to a fair solution, but are in no position to make demands that would threaten the security of Israel. 

Part of this lies on us being abundantly clear about what is on the negotiating table. There will be no significant return of descendants of Palestinian refugees and Israel will keep the majority of settlements.

Part of it lies on improving ties to Israel, just as the Arab normalisation did. This will both show Palestinians that time is not on their side and that refusal to negotiate will only result in a prolonging or possibly even worsening of the status quo. And on the flip side, Israel feeling diplomatically and militarily safer will also make Israel more amiable for concessions (and in terms of Arab normalisation, so will having something concrete to lose).

And perhaps most importantly, part of it lies on us not incentivising prolonging the conflict. Much of the aid we provide goes straight into the hands of corrupt Palestinian officials, who are thus incentivised not to find solutions to end the conflict. Much else goes into sponsoring terrorist activities. Unconditional aid is thus one of the biggest barriers to peace and reducing this could help pressure the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table in good faith. At the same time, we can provide positive incentives for reaching various milestones, like the huge investment plan that was part of the Trump deal.

I'm a pragmatic consequentialist. I would much rather the Palestinians get a less-than-ideal solution than permanent suffering due to Westerners convincing them that they are entitled to various things Israel will never (and for what it's worth, should never) agree to. Maximalist pro-Palestinians might think they have the moral high ground here, but there really is something particularly sinister about condemning Palestinians to continued disenfranchisement just so they can pat yourself on the back with how principled and moral they are.

This is why any successful negotiation must take into account the power dynamics between the countries. Palestinians are suffering under the status quo. Israelis are mostly not noticing it. And Palestinian bargaining power is only diminishing as time passes. This gives Israel much greater leverage in any negotiations. Pretending that Palestinians are correct to make unrealistic demands such as RoR is a huge disservice to Palestinians. Any negotiation must begin by acknowledging that Israel is here to stay instead of continuing to hope for her eventual destruction. 

In general, it is much easier to pressure the weaker part in a conflict rather than the stronger one. Not to mention that the premise is that it is Israel who has rejected negotiations, which is not true. Palestinians have repeatedly been offered a 2SS, but rejected it every time. Of course, if one thinks that the Palestinian demands are perfectly reasonable and Israel is just being evil refusing to make these huge concessions, applying pressure on the Palestinians might seem cruel. But if we are genuine in our desire to reach a fair, negotiated solution, we need to adopt a more pragmatic mindset. Whatever you think about the settlements or RoR, we should not forget what Israel realistically will agree to. Only by taking this into account can we start to find realistic solutions instead of relegating Palestinians to a permanent state of disenfranchisement.",18/06/21 06:01:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/o2i43g/we_must_start_to_put_pressure_on_the_palestinians/,122,205,1118,Gaza,top,all
19dch70,"Hamas releases their ""Narrative"" justifying and explaining 10/7","[https://www.palestinechronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PDF.pdf](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PDF.pdf)

This is quite a piece of work. It reads like it was written by Western leftists, using all the terminology that is like honey for bees: colonialism, oppression, ""open air prison"", even referring to Israel as the ""Zionist entity.""

The tl/dr:

1) The Palestinian fight started 105 years ago, with 30 years of British colonialism and 75 years of Israeli occupation;

2) Israel has done all sorts of horrible things to the Palestinians over the past 75 years and, with the help of the US, has ignored international law;

3) In response to the above, what did the world expect the Palestinian people to do in response?

4) We don't intentionally harm innocent civilians, especially women, children, and the elderly. They all died ""accidentally"" and in the confusion of 10/7;

5) None of the things we've been accused of doing on 10/7 happened. No the beheaded babies, not the rapes, none of it. All Zionist lies;

6) Oh, Israel has conscription for anyone over the age of 18 so they're not *really* civilians;

7) Hamas aren't terrorists, we're a national liberation and resistance movement;

8) We're not antisemitic. We don't have a problem with Jews, just with Zionist occupiers;

9) We denounce what happened to the Jews in the Holocaust but that was a European problem;

Here are their demands:

* Israel halts all aggression and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza
* Israel is held accountable for their crimes
* Everyone around the world should stand in solidarity with the Palestinians
* Israel will have no say in the future of Gaza
* No expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza
* Keep boycotting Israel",23/01/24 01:29:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/19dch70/hamas_releases_their_narrative_justifying_and/,128,477,274,Gaza,top,all
173hrpf,Where I stand - Palestinian Diaspora,"I'm Palestinian, from my dad and mom's side, from all my grandparents side. I grew up with the conflict, knowing what we lost as a result of the nakba. However, I was never a hamas supporter and I come from a ""NGO"" family so I normally have basic human decency and I am an avid supporter of human rights in my own country of residence and beyond.

When this whole thing started, my gut instinct told me that it is wrong. I know that what is being done to Israelis right now is wrong at its core, I have seen tons of videos that support this view. I am astonished by how people who aren't even related to the conflict but are just ""pro-palestinians"" go to extents to discredit the videos and call them fake when they are clearly not.

I see people with my same background sharing videos on socials about hamas, claiming this is a victory for us, cheering for them and demonstrating in the streets. I seriously feel so idk how to put it other than ""weird"" right now. On one hand I see what happened before in Gaza, an open air prison forcibly isolated at the mercy of Israel with no way to develop itself, men and women killed and extrajudicially imprisoned by the government for no apparent reason, my grandparents and extended family being kicked out of their village for it to be transformed into a kibbutz and a tourist site for Americans and just me being assumed a terrorist or coming from a ""bad and barbaric background"" simply because I am Palestinian. On the other side I see innocent people being killed, desecrated corpses, murdered children and kidnapped elders by hamas, supposedly being our ""resistance"".

I feel like we are treated very unfairly, and that the IDF is not this cute moral army. I want to visit my village, I want to visit Jerusalem, I want to walk across this land's beautiful shores. But given the circumstances it's impossible. I want to be part of the homeland I was nurtured with, part of the land where my ancestors lived for centuries. But I do not want to be part of an islamic theocracy, or support a group of people who kill indiscriminately and blindly, if hamas had the intelligence to carry this out, they could have done better. I see this as a HUGE moral and later physical loss to all the Palestinians, and somehow they still stupidly cheer. I just hope for everyone who is sane and moral safety throughout these times.",09/10/23 03:14:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/173hrpf/where_i_stand_palestinian_diaspora/,124,48,429,Gaza,top,all
18uo7ar,All of us who are connected to the daily life of the war remember Mia Schem,"War in Gaza
🇮🇱🔥🇵🇸
- All of us who are connected to the daily life of the war remember Mia Schem, 21 years old, an Israeli of French origin, kidnapped on October 7 from the SuperNova Music Festival, who shortly after the kidnapping appeared in a video published by Hamas with a bandaged arm and begging #Israel to do everything possible to free her.
- Mia has become very popular in Israel and unlike other freed hostages, she has given several interviews to the media and exposes her trauma a lot on her social networks, so her story is already well known in Israeli society.
- Among many of her experiences, she tells how she was wounded by a bullet in the arm and was transported for hours from one place to another until she was finally housed in the family home of one of the kidnappers.
- Mia claims that there she was ""treated"" by a veterinarian who operated on her wound without any anesthesia while they tied her up, and that to silence her screams they threatened to drag her to the tunnels if she did not stop complaining, until she was overcome by the shock of pain. ""Stop it. Or I'll send you to the tunnels!""
- I couldn't shower for 54 days despite having an open wound after surgery on my arm, nor clean the wound or change the bandages.
- They kept her in a dark room in this family home, and she describes that she lived with the kidnapper's children and wife, who hated her and mocked her because her husband couldn't stop looking at her with lust. At one point Mia says, ""All of Gaza are terrorists. They're Hamas.""
- Last week, after the intense Israeli bombings, Hamas moved her to some tunnels where she lived with other hostages (of whom she cannot reveal details).
- She says that they were kept in a dark cage and that they barely gave them anything to eat, just one piece of pita bread a day, and that during those days she reached her breaking point and gave up just before being released.
- He said that the conditions in those tunnels are beyond imagination and that many of the hostages have been held in those conditions for more than 80 days.
- During the last interview she burst into tears for having left the other hostages behind after her release (the tremendous typical survivor's guilt) . - Although several weeks have passed since she returned home, in each interview it is clear that Mia He is still in shock and with his emotions stunted, he avoids mentioning the sexual abuse suffered by the hostages in the tunnels, and he is still in survivor mode.
- Your story is not unique, it is also the story of 240 other kidnapped people, a hundred of them still living that hell.",30/12/23 19:58:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18uo7ar/all_of_us_who_are_connected_to_the_daily_life_of/,124,150,483,Gaza,top,all

1806tpw,Did the world forget so easily about the 7.10 massacre?,"A bit of backstory
For those who live under a rock and don't know what happened,on 7.10 Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel,in the aftermath 1,200 people were murdered,240 hostages in Gaza and 200,000 israelis were displaced from their home,
That was the event that kickstarted the war(for more details feel free to search up online)

In response Israel began a military campaign in Gaza with the goal to dismantle and eliminate Hamas entirely,a TERRORIST organisation known for using the civilian population as Human Shields and the civilian infastructure as ""humanitarian"" shields,fighting an enemy who uses such guerilla tactics(if you can call it like that) is very hard to do so without hurting the civilian population they're hiding behind.

It's not right to harm civilians even under such circumstances I know and believe me Israel is doing the maximum effort to minimise the civilian casualities but Israel can't guarantee their safety,Gaza's safety and security was entrusted in the hands of Hamas and they failed Gaza,Hamas did the exact opposite and cared only for their safety and now innoncent Gazans are suffering not because of Israel but because of Hamas.

The media presents only the poor Gazans but they neglected completely the precursor to their condition,the media didn't show their celebrations of the massacre on 7.10,they didn't show the dead bodies of Israeli men,women and children laying lifeless on the streets,they didn't show the horrible footage filmed by Hamas terrorists on 7.10

Why?

Maybe because it's not interesting to watch idk
And before you blame me for ignorance and ""whataboutism"",I know that some media outlets did cover the massacre but many big media outlets out there didn't,instead they were too busy with Gaza.

Just don't forget how Gaza got to its current state

wi2173,PIJ rocket misfire kills 4 children. Israel blamed. A common tactic in past conflicts.,"An explosion killing seven people including four children rocked Jabalia in the Northern Gaza strip. Social media and various news sites immediately blamed Israel for the attack and the Hamas-run heath ministry added the seven deaths to their tally for a new total of 24 who have been killed since the operation in Gaza began.

But what actually happened?

A [video](https://twitter.com/manniefabian/status/1556012314788347904?s=20&t=mjqr3LnGR-Up1oAJ1JOcVg) captured by a resident shows a rocket being launched, immediately going out of control, and smashing into ground near the launch site. The IDF claims to have detected the launch as well as its subsequent impact in Gaza (likely using the Iron Dome trajectory detection system). In addition, the IDF claims its last bombing run in Jabalia was two hours before the alleged strike.



New 

As of 6am approximately 580 rockets had been fired towards Israel with 120 falling short into Gaza. The material and personal damage these misfires cause are attributed to Israel as a matter of policy both to remove responsibility from the groups that fire them but to also to generate negative PR against the IDF. Such claims are generally accepted as fact with very few people questioning their legitimacy or even attempting to find the truth.

In May of 2021 approximately 4,360 rockets were fired at Israel with 680 landing in the Gaza strip. 256 Palestinians were killed with an unknown number by said misfires. Most if not all have been falsely attributed to Israel as well including those caused by Hamas-fired rockets. Video of such a launch in 2021 can be seen [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/ABTyRN57afs?feature=share).

Lies and deception are used as justification for continued aggression by terrorists in Gaza which put their civilian population at risk. Unless people start to hold Hamas and the PIJ accountable for their actions how can we ever hope to solve the conflict? Are falsehoods that hurt Israel honestly worth the lives of innocent Palestinians?",07/08/22 00:05:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/wi2173/pij_rocket_misfire_kills_4_children_israel_blamed/,122,318,314,Gaza,top,all

pv7kd1,Western pro-Palestinian groups harm the Palestinian cause,"Some of the Western backers on both sides of the conflict do more harm than good when it comes to resolving the conflict.  And while I think that many have criticized the Evangelical backing of Israel and pointed out that they may not care about the interests of Israel but no one has really pointed out the harm that pro-Palestinian activists in the West do to the Palestinian cause.  Here are some points:

&#x200B;

* **They don't seem to believe that Israeli lives matter.**  The entire Iron Dome kerfuffle has been debated ad nauseam so I won't go into that again.  What made me even angrier than that was the reaction of the pro-Palestinian Western ""allies"" to the prisoner escape situation earlier.  To hear JVP talk about the prisoners, you'd think they were Nelson Mandela rather than what they actually were - violent terrorists and murderers.  I'm assuming that JVP would be horrified if Amiram Ben Uliel, who was convicted in the horrific Duma attack, were to escape an Israeli prison and Ben Gvir and the Kahanist extremists celebrated him as a ""freedom fighter.""  And they'd be right to do so.  But their celebration of the escape of violent Palestinian terrorists suggests that they are just as bad as the Kahanist extremists they reportedly condemn.  I'm not sure why they think that anyone in Israel would take them seriously as being ""for peace"" given their embrace of Palestinian violence.

&#x200B;

* **Every Israeli Jew, especially every Israeli Jewish politician, is the same.**  There was a telling example last year about the attitude of BDS activists and left-fringe US politicians that I've already brought up but will mention again.  AOC literally pulled out of a virtual memorial to honor Yitzhak Rabin last year after getting pressured by groups like If Not Now and Jewish Currents.  Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist because of the Oslo Accords.  If Rabin isn't pure enough for you, then no Israeli politician will suffice.  Not every Israeli politician is a Kahanist extremist but pro-Palestinian Western activists choose to even view the Israeli left through that lens.  And that is even before they engage the Israeli center or Israeli right, the politicians who have actual pull in Israeli society and would be necessary for any compromise.

&#x200B;

* **They take an all-or-nothing approach to the conflict.**  I've said in the past that the approach of certain think tanks and activists on the Palestinian conflict is baffling.  There must be a ""final"" political solution now despite the fact that neither side is ready to make the hard compromises that such negotiations entail.  This is in contrast with their approach to every other conflict.  Agreements like the JCPOA are to be embraced despite not even really doing much to end Iran's nuclear program, but concepts like ""shrinking the conflict"" and ""economic peace"" on the Israeli conflict cannot be embraced.  There might not be a formal political process right now but the steps that the Israeli government wants to take can absolutely open the doorway for a peace deal in the future.  Things like a ceasefire in Gaza or steps to strengthen the PA are absolutely necessary to bring a sense of security to both sides and strengthen moderates.",25/09/21 14:15:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/pv7kd1/western_propalestinian_groups_harm_the/,119,180,540,Gaza,top,all

18n31wr,"Why Palestinian cities are called ""refugee camps"" even though there are no refugee camps."," Please take a few minutes and read it until the end because knowing it is essential to understand the conflict!

⭕️ I see that many are wondering why several Palestinian cities are called ""refugee camps"" even though there are no refugee camps in the place (?) , and I am going to try to explain it without making you boring
- How can it be that Palestinian cities and neighborhoods that were refugee camps in the late 40s, early 50s, continue to maintain that status even though these refugee camps are today modern cities with all the services, Where do the children, grandchildren and even great-grandchildren of those refugees live, most of whom have already died of old age?
-How can it be that the son or grandson of a Palestinian refugee from those years maintains the status of ""refugee"" today? Refugee from where?

⭕️ Well, the answer is political and economic:
- First of all, the status continues from generation to generation to perpetuate the conflict and keep it open and latent in the media.
- Of the hundreds of millions of refugees of the 40s and 50s, this ""eternal refugee"" status only remains alive for the Palestinians.
- If my grandfather, or any of yours, was a refugee from a war, he is not covered by the UN refugee agencies unless he is Palestinian.
- For Palestinians, this ""refugee"" status is hereditary! This is how ridiculous and unfair this system is created exclusively for them and for no one else on the planet.
- In fact, for all the refugees from all the wars on the planet there is a single agency that cares for them, the UNHCR, while for the eternal ""Palestinian refugees"" and for all their descendants there is a UN agency exclusively created to finance them. them, UNRWA.
- I repeat it so that it is understood: There is an exclusive agency for the Palestinians and another agency for the rest of the world, and that despite the fact that there are hardly any Palestinians alive from those years.
- Of all the refugees from all the wars in history, only the Palestinians inherit the ""title"" and have rights to the billions and billions of dollars that UNRWA receives.

⭕️ What do you feel when you hear that ""Israel attacked this or that refugee camp""? Surprise? Bewilderment? Gonna?
- Well, that is another reason why they still keep those names in their cities, so that they function as propaganda due to their emotional component.
- On the other hand, the Israeli cities attacked daily from Gaza or Lebanon are barely mentioned by the media because since they do not have the label ""refugee camp"" they are NOT of interest to anyone outside of Israel, and this despite the fact that technically, Virtually all of Israel's cities were founded by refugees.

⭕️ Definition of refugee: ""A person who, due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside his or her country of birth and is incapable, or, due to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, because he has no nationality and is outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is incapable, due to to such fear, to be willing to return to it.""
- Pay attention to where it says ""outside your country."" Are Palestinians born in Gaza and the West Bank outside their country? NO, right?

1bq3j7b,My thoughts about the war," 
Hello everybody, I am an Israeli soldier, currently serving in a combat position on the eastern border of Israel. I have never been to Gaza and have never shot my rifle. 
It's been a very long time now since I wanted to write about my feelings in regards to everything that's going on. 
 
I have always wanted combat enlistment, ever since high school. As I mentioned, I am positioned at the eastern border of Israel, so I wasn't anywhere near the battlefield. However, in recent months, certain thoughts I've been struggling with for years have begun bubbling to the surface.

 It's important for me to say that I don't think Israel is the hellish, Nazi-like state a lot of people are now comparing it to. 
 
However, I disagree with the current Israeli mindset, which is that we're fighting two million terrorists or that victory could only be achieved by extreme brutality, even by committing terrible war crimes and using October 7th as a justification.
 
I grew up in Tel Aviv, which is considered to be a pretty liberal city, so I never felt pressured to feel in one way or another about the debate. Tel Aviv's a melting pot for opinions varying all across the political spectrum, and my parents and teachers always supported me in constructing my own opinion based on facts and evidence. 
 
I did a lot of research into the history of the debate, the creation of Israel, and what we did to the Palestinian communities.
 
In the end, I love my country, and I think a lot of people are failing to understand the motive behind European-Jewish people migrating to Israel from Europe, which is to escape the non-stop antisemitism that was raging in Europe during those times. I do believe the Jews back then didn't have much of a choice, and so I don't blame them for coming to the only place they had some historical connection to.
 
However, I also agree with the Palestinian point of view, the rightful anger of being driven from your home, and the pain of being treated like a B-type citizen. 
As a soldier in combat enlistment who has been to many Palestinian villages, after seeing the Palestinian way of life for a long time, I began realizing that, while the term occupation isn't accurate, it is somewhat reflective of reality.



There is *a lot* of racism towards Arabic people and Muslims in the Israeli military, with opinions as extreme as saying we should kill them all, and (in combat units at least, not sure how it is in other areas of the military) not enough positive opinions to counter all the hate. 

This definitely results in a great number of cases where Palestinian people are being mistreated. 
I never took part in stuff like this, but I heard plenty of stories from guys in my platoon, and let's just say it doesn't make me feel patriotic. 
 
After the war started, I was very pro-Israel and, I admit, started somewhat leaning towards the ""win at all costs"" type of mentality after the atrocities of October 7th. most Jews killed in one day since the Holocaust.  


But ever since, my opinions have changed. Racism  towards Arabic people has never been so intense in Israel, and it seems everybody in my platoon no longer wants to serve to protect the country but to spite Muslims and Palestinians. I've heard people say we should nuke Gaza (which is wrong on so many levels) and exile all Arabs and whatnot. 






I think that after what happened on October 7th, Israel, for the first time, isn't holding back at all, and while it's wrong to call it genocide, since Israel is still doing its best to avoid civilian casualties and Hamas is using civilian infrastructures as operational bases, I started thinking about all the poor, innocent kids whose lives were ruined; their only crime is being born.



 
There has definitely been a lot of unnecessarily killing on behalf of the Israeli side, with some people being far too careless and, frankly, probably wanting to kill as much as they can, believing it was the right thing to do.



I honestly can't see an ending to all of this or the whole conflict. There's just so much hatred on both sides at this point, and peace seems like a hollow dream right now.

1an112x,"HAMAS EXPOSED, the body is not greater than the head.","
Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, climbed the ranks not for killing Jews or planning attacks against the IDF, but because he killed Palestinians. For years, Sinwar was known as ""the butcher of Khan Yunis.""

In 1989, at just 27, Yahya Sinwar was convicted and imprisoned in an Israeli jail for the murder of dozens of Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.

His brutality in killing innocent Palestinians was horrific. Some were killed because he suspected they collaborated with Israel, while others because they behaved in ways he deemed contrary to Islam.

During his interrogation, he confessed to some of the killings, describing in detail what he did to each of those Palestinians. Here are some quotes from the interrogation transcript:

""He admitted to being in contact with Israeli intelligence… and also admitted to bringing girls to his shop and engaging with them. I decided to kill him,"" he said. According to him, they took that Palestinian in a car to the cemetery. ""On the way, I tied his eyes with a cloth so he wouldn't see. I put him in a large grave, strangled him with a chokehold I had. After I strangled him, I wrapped him in a white cloth with a blanket and closed the grave. I was convinced that Rasmi (the collaborator) deserved to die.""

In other cases, Yahya Sinwar personally killed more Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel or behaving in ways he deemed contrary to Islam. One Palestinian was beaten to death with punches, another was strangled with a chokehold, and another Palestinian was shot dead.

In an especially appalling case, he forced a Palestinian from Khan Yunis to bring his brother, whom he suspected of collaborating with Israel, to dig a grave and bury him alive, even though the Palestinian denied collaborating.

An Israeli Shin Bet investigator who interrogated Yahya Sinwar said that Sinwar confessed to these killings with cold-bloodedness, recounting them without flinching.

According to him, it seemed like Yahya Sinwar enjoyed carrying out these killings. In addition to Palestinians Sinwar killed himself, he ordered and sent other Hamas operatives to kill many more Palestinians.

Even within the Israeli prison, Sinwar showed cruelty to prisoners who did not find favor in his eyes.

Yahya Sinwar was born in Gaza, raised in Khan Yunis, and his family lived in a house owned by the UN, and he studied in one of the UN schools in Gaza. ""The butcher of Khan Yunis"" became such a radical Islamic terrorist within the UN education system, like most terrorists in Gaza.

It wasn't long after Sinwar was released from prison and returned to Gaza that he became the leader of Hamas in Gaza.

Under Sinwar's leadership in Gaza, protests and opposition to Hamas were violently suppressed, Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel were brutally murdered, and Gazans who behaved contrary to Islam were also identified as collaborators and murdered. All under the control of Yahya Sinwar and often under his explicit orders.

For years under Sinwar's rule, Hamas took all the aid money that entered Gaza and built terror tunnels and infrastructure within the civilian population to maximize civilian casualties during war to pressure for a ceasefire.

Yahya Sinwar planned the October 7th attack and sent thousands of Hamas terrorists to brutally murder Israeli civilians.

This is the man whom those calling for a ceasefire want to allow to continue to rule Gaza, the man who, if there is a ceasefire, will continue to kill Jews and behave with such cruelty to Gaza's Palestinian residents.
